<div class="entry-content"><p>Today I am 40 years old.</p>

<p>40 is a confusing age. Old enough to not be a kid anymore by any reasonable definition.  Still young, inexperienced, and stupid enough to feel like one anyway. Maybe that last bit never goes away. Maybe it only intensifies.</p>

<p>One feature of my version of me at 40 is that I have gradually, through the years, weeded my habits of many of the meaningless societal norms I had programmed into me as a child. For example, Kelly and I don&#8217;t celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day or religious holidays for faiths we don&#8217;t hold (so, really, any of them). And, birthdays are just arbitrary landmarks in an ever-accruing collection of minutes and seconds between birth and death. Christmas, Easter, Halloween, etc. are just days like any other, marked primarily by different music, food, and color schemes. &#8220;Bah, humbug&#8221; says this crusty, aging ruiner-of-annual-spirit!</p>

<p>For some reason people pay special attention to the birthdays and anniversaries that are evenly divisible by 10. Why 10? What&#8217;s so special about 10? Sure, it has some interesting mathematical properties, but we don&#8217;t tend to make much use of them when we measure time.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember my 10th, 20th, or 30th birthdays.  I don&#8217;t recall having done anything spectacular while I was of those ages. Nothing especially remarkable happened to me when I was 10, 20, or 30.</p>

<p>But, here I am at 40, somehow unable to shake the made-up significance of this particular instance of modulus 10 equaling zero.</p>

<p>Here are some facts about becoming 40:</p>

<ul>
<li>The vast majority of people from my part of the world live to be at least 40. It&#8217;s only one day more remarkable than turning 39 + 364 days. And in fact one day <em>less</em> remarkable than turning 39 + 366 days (depending on leap years I guess).</li>
<li>At 40, I&#8217;m statistically probably over half way through with my life. While this might sound heavy, it&#8217;s actually already been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_life_expectancy">true for a few years</a>. I just didn&#8217;t write about it then, because my age wasn&#8217;t evenly divisible by 10.</li>
<li>My turning 40 is slightly more remarkable than my birth and my eventual death. Everybody is born and everybody dies. Not <em>everybody</em> turns 40.</li>
<li>At this age, I&#8217;m becoming aware of just how long and short 40 years is. Literally everything that has ever happened to me can fit into 40 years. If I do another 40, twice as much can happen in total, but&#8230;</li>
<li>Relative to the age of the earth or many other arbitrarily choosable lengths of time, 40 years is so insignificant I might as well not even exist.</li>
<li>40 years ago today, my amazing, kind, wise mother must have been going through one of the most terrifying experiences of her life. She was 19, and I was a human being coming into the world that she was going to have to somehow take care of.  I try to imagine myself doing this at 19. What an imaginary disaster! I hope I&#8217;ve been worth it. She sure did a great job, especially during those times when I was an unreasonable mess (specifically, when I was&#8230; <em>19</em>!!!). Happy Mother&#8217;s Day, mom!</li>
</ul>


<p>Now that I&#8217;m old, I&#8217;m supposed to be able to give young people advice. I don&#8217;t really have any, so instead I&#8217;ll give young readers a glimpse into what 40 is like (for me, anyway).  Here goes.</p>

<p>Being 40 feels very much like being 30. Except your body hurts more. I say that even as someone who is in significantly better shape at 40 than I was at 30.  It still literally hurts. Everyone likes to joke about this, so you think it&#8217;s just a joke like those idiotic jokes everyone likes to tell about being chained to their spouses and such. But it&#8217;s real. Sorry about that. Also, I can&#8217;t stay awake as long as I used to without getting seriously grumpy. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m generally less fun than I used to be. That&#8217;s saying something, because I&#8217;ve probably never been the person people considered to be &#8220;fun&#8221; anyway.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s all superficial. At 40 I feel a much greater sense of appreciation for all I have and all I have been able to do in my life.  I <a href="http://kellyjeanne.org">won at marriage</a> and had the gift of doing it at a very early age, giving me the ability to experience a large portion of my life with <a href="http://kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a>. I&#8217;ve made a <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">remarkable career for myself</a>. I&#8217;ve had the privilege to travel around the world, working, meeting people, speaking at conferences, and generally exceeding any expectation I&#8217;ve ever had for how things would turn out.</p>

<p>I feel a much stronger sense of urgency to remember to appreciate every minute of every day.  I&#8217;m professionally much more accomplished than I was at 20 or 30. But I don&#8217;t feel the magnitude of that every day. Those things even themselves out on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">hedonic treadmill</a>.</p>

<p>I do, however, feel the magnitude of my increasing, deepening love for my wife and my family. I understand more acutely the rarity of true friendship and the scarcity of <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2014/01/19/empathy/">empathy</a>. And I have learned to differentiate between proximity and truth when it comes to human relationships. A relationship doesn&#8217;t have to be constantly tended to to remain precious, but it must be revered.</p>

<p>Like turning 40, none of these realizations is remarkable. But, sometimes just feeling and expressing is enough. As I get older I realize not everything I do has to be an attempt to be remarkable.</p>

<p>I hope you have a good day today, even if&#8211;especially if&#8211;it&#8217;s not your birthday. Thanks for reading this.</p>
