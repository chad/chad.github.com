<div class="entry-content"><p><a
href="http://www.anomaly.org/wade/archives/programming_philosophy/000050.html">G.<br />
Wade Johnson on programming idioms.</a></p>
<p>
<p>A lot of what he says relates very clearly to the motivation behind <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/5303">this<br />
talk</a> that David Black and I are giving at <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a> in July. New<br />
speakers of Ruby-as-a-second-language often feverishly attempt to force-fit<br />
Ruby into being a syntactically different copy of whatever their<br />
&quot;native&quot; language is. An oft-cited example from the Ruby world is<br />
static vs. dynamic typing (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/RubyTypesAndClasses.rdoc,v">RubyTypesAndClasses</a>),<br />
but it definitely doesn&#8217;t end there.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot easier to learn a new programming language than it is to<br />
learn a new spoken/written language. It may be for this reason that, when<br />
learning a new spoken language, we tend to come with humility, but when<br />
learning a new programming language, the attitude of the learner is usually<br />
a lot less humble. So, new users of a language assume that they already<br />
know the one true way to express programming constructs, and the only task<br />
at hand is to learn how to syntactictally convert their thoughts into the<br />
new language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are exceptions in each camp, of course. An Indian friend of mine<br />
described a college professor who refused to learn idiomatic English and<br />
would constantly use direct translations of colloquial Malayalam phrases in<br />
class. His favorite, used when students were bugging him about something,<br />
was (emphatically) &quot;Don&#8217;t want&#8212;Don&#8217;t want. Climbing<br />
on my head!&quot; In Malayalam, this phrase means something and has<br />
probably evolved based on a combination of factors, including how easily it<br />
flows from the tongue. In English, it&#8217;s just strange sounding<br />
nonsense. Since programs actually have to work (i.e. there is a<br />
fast-feedback validation that happens when we write a program), programmers<br />
will sometimes go to great lengths, building elaborate frameworks to<br />
attempt to make a new language behave like their &quot;native&quot;<br />
language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Wade (is it &quot;Wade&quot;?) talks about idioms as being singular items<br />
that can be learned, like patterns or tricks. You learn one, you over-use<br />
it, you start to use it correctly, and then you learn another. I know<br />
he&#8217;s presenting a simplified look at the process, but I think<br />
it&#8217;s important to separate the learning of a language&#8217;s idioms<br />
from learning what is idiomatic in that language. Learning of idioms is<br />
about knowledge transfer whereas learning about &quot;idiomatic&quot;<br />
requires a thought process change. I think of the former as being a step<br />
toward the latter.</p>
</p>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>On an unrelated note, Wade makes an interesting point about what I would<br />
call &quot;dissonance&quot; (see <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/SeasideDissonance.rdoc,v">SeasideDissonance</a><br />
and <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA/Tension"><span class="caps">MFA</span>:Tension</a>).</p>
</p>
<pre>
   Idiom can also serve as a warning. An unusual or advanced idiom
   should tell the reader that he is entering dangerous territory. This
   is a message that it's time to pay close attention.
</pre>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>On another unrelated note, I think we must define both &quot;simple&quot;<br />
and &quot;expressive&quot; differently:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  The simpler the language, the quicker you get to the end of this cycle.
  But, a simpler language is not as expressive. So, you find yourself doing
  more work than should be necessary. A more expressive language takes
  longer to learn, but it's easier to pass on subtle shades of meaning to
  the maintenance programmer (possibly yourself).
</pre>
<p>
<p>I think of Scheme as being both extremely simple and extremely expressive,<br />
while I think of a language like Java as being very complex but not very<br />
expressive. I would be more likely to say: &quot;But, a more rigid language<br />
is not as expressive.&quot; And to me, rigidity is much more likely to<br />
result from complexity than simplicity.</p>
