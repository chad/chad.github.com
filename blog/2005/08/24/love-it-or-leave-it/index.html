<div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in a <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Writing/MyJobWentToIndiaDone.rdoc,v">previous<br />
post</a>, though my goal was to help others, the process of writing <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> has already helped <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>
<p>While living in Bangalore, I saw <a
href="http://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> speak at a<br />
Thoughtworks-sponsored event on agile development. The one thing he said<br />
that has stuck with me since then is that when he wants to learn about<br />
something, he writes about it. It&#8217;s obvious that writing a book or an<br />
essay on a topic would help you learn about it, but it never occurred to me<br />
that these guru-authors might be writing about things that they<br />
didn&#8217;t already know before starting a book or article. Writing is<br />
both a process of documentation <tt>and</tt> discovery.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense when you&#8217;re writing about a technology.<br />
There are bound to be nooks and crannies that you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
explored, even if you&#8217;re an expert. To present a complete picture,<br />
you&#8217;re going to have to dig into things you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
had a need for.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What wasn&#8217;t as obvious to me was that the same would be true of<br />
non-tech writing. My book isn&#8217;t a reference manual. It&#8217;s a<br />
collection of bits of advice. It&#8217;s less about knowledge and more<br />
about common sense, good judgement, and wisdom. So the nooks and crannies I<br />
explored as I wrote weren&#8217;t in obscure language features or rarely<br />
touched APIs. They were in concepts that I had either taught myself or had<br />
absorbed through osmosis from the wiser people around me throughout my<br />
career.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>While I was codifying ideas that had been everyday companions to me for<br />
years, they went from being rough and ragged to polished. Not only were<br />
they clearer for my readers (the purpose of the polishing) but they were<br />
actually <em>better</em>. As a result I have produced advice that, at least<br />
on a granular level, is new to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this one particular section of my book that I learned a<br />
<em>lot</em> from. I&#8217;ve read it many times since it was written, and<br />
I&#8217;ve thought about it even more. It&#8217;s called &quot;Love it or<br />
Leave it&quot;. The premise is that, if you don&#8217;t love what<br />
you&#8217;re doing, you won&#8217;t be <em>great</em> at it. Or to flip it<br />
around, if you love your job, you stand a much greater chance of being<br />
great at it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Stated alone like this, it couldn&#8217;t get any more obvious. But this<br />
book is about making things actionable. I realized as I thought about it<br />
that I was unable to come up with a recent personal example of how<br />
<em>I</em> had taken this most primitive piece of advice and done something<br />
about it. My career had taken a turn that most Americans would consider to<br />
be &quot;success&quot;, and I had let it take me where it wanted. That<br />
meant management in big corporations.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But the undercurrent that was always tugging on me was that I looked at a<br />
lot of my friends in the industry with a feeling of envy. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could (at least attempt to) innovate all day. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could write Ruby code full time. I wished <em>I</em> could work<br />
in an environment that was 100% focused on getting things done instead of<br />
drifting in the tides of corporate politics. I wanted to work for a company<br />
that was focused on <em>winning</em> instead of trying not to<br />
<em>lose</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So I decided to take my own advice and find this environment I&#8217;d been<br />
looking for. On the same day that I decided to look, I <a
href="http://naviance.com">found it</a>. <a
href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> and I are moving to Denver, so<br />
that I can be a full time Ruby (on <a
href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>) developer for Naviance.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Several years in the big corporate world creates a lot of inertia.<br />
It&#8217;s no easy decision to make. But it feels <em>right</em> once<br />
it&#8217;s done, and the interactions I&#8217;ve had with my new team only<br />
serve to reinforce my choice.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The team is going to stay small and focused. We&#8217;re looking for a <a
href="http://www.naviance.com/company/webdes.html">designer with Rails<br />
experience</a>. Might this be the leap you&#8217;ve been waiting to make?</p>
