  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I spent a few minutes (literally) and whipped a small hack<br />
(&quot;spike&quot; for you XPers among us) of a Ruby version of TestDox<br />
(see <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/AgileDox.rdoc,v">AgileDox</a>).<br />
I&#8217;m going to use it on my own code for a while before doing anything<br />
proper with it. Right now, it&#8217;s a whopping 37 lines of Ruby. If<br />
you&#8217;re interested, have a look here:</p>

href="http://www.chadfowler.com/ruby/testdox.rb.txt">www.chadfowler.com/ruby/testdox.rb.txt</a></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>You can run it like so:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  ruby testdox.rb test_source1.rb test_source2.rb (etc.)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thoughtworks&#8217; Joe Walnes has posted a link (<a
href="http://joe.truemesh.com/blog/archives/agile/000047.html">joe.truemesh.com/blog/archives/agile/000047.html</a>)<br />
to an interesting project called <b>TestDox</b> (<a
href="http://agiledox.sourceforge.net/">agiledox.sourceforge.net/</a>).<br />
Given a suite of JUnit (<a href="http://www.junit.org">www.junit.org</a>)<br />
tests, it generates documentation.</p>
<p>
<p>Like <span class="caps">FIT</span> (<a href="http://fit.c2.com">fit.c2.com</a>), this is an<br />
interesting bridge between executable code and documentation. TestDox<br />
converts camelCasedTestMethodNames into separate words, so this code</p>
</p>
<pre>
  public class DogTest extends TestCase
  {
    public void testBarksAtCats() {}
    public void testEatsALot() {}
    public void testSleepsWhenNotBarkingOrEating() {}
  }
</pre>
<p>
<p>&#8230;would produce the documentation that looks basically like<br />
(untested):</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><b>Dog</b></p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Barks at cats</li>
<li>Eats a lot</li>
<li>Sleeps when not barking or eating</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>This has arguably limited usefulness, and it depends trickily on class and<br />
method naming conventions. But, it starts the ideas flowing, and<br />
TestDox&#8217;s parent project (<b>Agiledox</b>) will hopefully expand and<br />
explore these much further. It may sound like heresy to the XP world, but<br />
I&#8217;d be interested in being able to do this sort of thing round-trip<br />
(documentation -&gt; test -&gt; documentation -&gt; test -&gt;<br />
documentation -&gt; &#8230;)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In my own unit testing, I haven&#8217;t always been so methodical about<br />
using method names that describe a characteristic of the entity being<br />
tested. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t use descriptive names, but I may<br />
include tests with names like &quot;testEatBadTastingFood()&quot;, which<br />
describes a specific scenario but not an ongoing behaviour of dogs. Running<br />
my tests through TestDox might generate misleading documentation.<br />
It&#8217;s not that dogs generally eat food they don&#8217;t like. I just<br />
wanted to test what a dog would/should do in the eventuality that they<br />
<b>did</b> eat bad food. I&#8217;m not sure if my current behaviour is bad<br />
or good, but it will definitely be something I think about next time I sit<br />
down to do some coding.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>A fear I have is that, with this tool in place, I may be tempted to think<br />
about what the generated documentation will look like as I write my tests.<br />
This would create a new and potentially conflicting objective in my test<br />
writing. And, since I tend to do test driven design, it would ultimately<br />
impact my design and coding decisions.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ruling out the possibility that this change in thinking would<br />
<b>improve</b> my code. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to try and find out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Howard Rheingold (<a
href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/001184.html">www.smartmobs.com/archives/001184.html</a>)<br />
posted a link to a a wearable buffering video camera (<a
href="http://www.idg.net/ic_1322387_9677_1-5042.html">www.idg.net/ic_1322387_9677_1-5042.html</a>).<br />
Apparently, you wear it on your eye glasses or cap, it buffers 30 seconds<br />
of video (of what you&#8217;re seeing) at a time, and you can press a<br />
button whenever you like to save the previous 30 seconds permanently. They<br />
(<a href="http://www.mydejaview.com">www.mydejaview.com</a>) have another<br />
model that can save up to 4 hours.</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether to be excited or frightened, but I&#8217;m<br />
leaning toward excited. It&#8217;s still pretty bulky, but I imagine<br />
another year&#8217;ll solve that. I&#8217;d like to add a small playback<br />
display, so when I space out during a conversation, I can gracefully<br />
recover by pressing the capture button, excusing myself, and rewinding the<br />
last 30 seconds:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  &amp;quot;How's that sound to you, Chad?&amp;quot;
  (wakes up)
  &amp;quot;Uh...yea...hold on just a moment.  I'll be right back.&amp;quot;
  (leaves room, plays back video, returns)
  &amp;quot;Right, then...&amp;quot; (potentially less ignorant conversation ensues)
</pre>
<p>
<p>Even more exciting&#8212;but farther off in the future&#8212;is the<br />
possibility of combining the audio portion of this technology with wireless<br />
networking, speech recognition, and text data mining. Imagine the power of<br />
having a personal, searchable (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/LatentSemanticIndexing.rdoc,v">LatentSemanticIndexing</a>),<br />
index of every conversation you have and everything you hear. May that<br />
sounds a little spooky? Doesn&#8217;t feel quite right to you? That&#8217;s<br />
just the feeling of old age creeping over you&#8230;it&#8217;s OK. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently, Microsoft is brewing up their own new search engine technology,<br />
which has got some people thinking they&#8217;re about to try to<br />
Netscape-ize Google (<a
href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2071">scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2071</a>).<br />
I don&#8217;t really buy into the idea that any company is evil (<a
href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22microsoft+is+evil%22&FORM=SMCRT">search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22microsoft+is+evil%22&amp;<span class="caps">FORM</span>=<span class="caps">SMCRT</span></a>),<br />
but I still like this idea: <a
href="http://www.idlewords.com/boycott.pl">www.idlewords.com/boycott.pl</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>The idea is that, if enough people setup their robots.txt to disallow<br />
Microsoft&#8217;s bot, it will create holes in MS&#8217;s relevance<br />
ranking, rendering the search engine ineffective. I don&#8217;t want to<br />
ruin Microsoft. But, it would be extremely interesting if a simple,<br />
distributed idea like this actually had an effect on a seemingly inevitable<br />
outcome.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Join in! The numbers are small now.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The disadvantage here is that when Microsoft <b>does</b> kill the<br />
competition, your site won&#8217;t be indexed. I think can live with that<br />
for at least as long as it takes to `rm robots.txt` and get crawled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess it&#8217;s been a couple of years now since Dave (<a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave">pragprog.com/pragdave</a>) and I had a<br />
discussion about attempting to extend some of the benefits of paired<br />
programming (<a
href="http://www.pairprogramming.com">www.pairprogramming.com</a>) to<br />
individual programming sessions. Unfortunately, this 5 minute-ish<br />
conversation resulted in little more than a dangling Wiki link (<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?MorePragmaticTips">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?MorePragmaticTips</a>)<br />
with a catchy tag line. I&#8217;ve revisited it occasionally to see if<br />
anyone had anything interesting to say.</p>
<p>
<p>In his latest Code Kata installment (<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataSeven.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataSeven.rdoc,v</a>),<br />
Dave has&#8212;probably unintentionally&#8212;started filling in the hole.<br />
He suggests a structured, 3-step approach to reviewing your own code, with<br />
the goal of developing new perspectives in the process. It&#8217;s this<br />
same role-playing-ish type of process that I&#8217;ve had in mind since we<br />
discussed the &quot;solo pairing&quot; idea.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Zen Buddhists [oh no&#8230;there he goes with that Buddhism thing<br />
again] have developed a concept called &quot;Beginner&#8217;s Mind&quot;.<br />
Shunryu Suzuki-roshi, author of &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#8217;s Mind&quot;<br />
(<a
href="http://www.booksite.com/texis/scripts/oop/click_ord/addcart.html?sid=3471&Buy=0834800799">www.booksite.com/texis/scripts/oop/click_ord/addcart.html?sid=3471&amp;Buy=0834800799</a>),<br />
writes:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  &amp;quot;In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the
   expert's there are few.&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>As per my limited understanding, the goal is to always think as if you were<br />
seeing or doing something for the first time. Beginners aren&#8217;t<br />
usually proud or boastful. They are impressionable. Beginners don&#8217;t<br />
already <b>know</b> why things are the way they are or what the best course<br />
of action is at any given moment. They&#8217;re more likely to actually<br />
stop and look around them.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This strikes a chord with the solo pairing idea. As we program lone,<br />
there&#8217;s a lot of seemingly autonomous stuff that can happen without<br />
any intentional thought. We get into a rhythm, not noticing the familiar<br />
scenery around us. Like driving to work every day, we are dulled to the<br />
routine of the environment in which we work. Think about it next time you<br />
sit down by yourself to write a program: How conscious are you of the names<br />
you choose for variables, methods, or classes? For the &quot;easy&quot;<br />
problems, how critical are you of your own norms and rituals? I&#8217;m not<br />
suggesting that you aren&#8217;t <b>conscientious</b>&#8212;in fact it<br />
might be conscientiousness that has led many of us to a rigid (most of us<br />
prefer to say &quot;correct&quot;) way of approaching many of life&#8217;s<br />
little problems.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But, when you&#8217;re sitting with another person&#8212;especially if this<br />
person is a beginner&#8212;they&#8217;re not inside your head with you.<br />
They&#8217;re more likely to question your established protocol. &quot;Why<br />
do you put &#8216;p underscore&#8217; in those variable names?&quot; This<br />
might be a little frustrating at first until you irritatedly answer,<br />
&quot;Because it shows that they&#8217;re parameters to the method. Our old<br />
code&#8217;s methods were so long and jumbled that you often couldn&#8217;t<br />
remember where a variable was declared, so we had to do this. Thank God<br />
we&#8217;ve stopped coding like that&#8230;hmm, why <b>do</b> I put those<br />
&#8216;p underscore&#8217;s there?&quot;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Dave asks:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  &amp;quot;However, doing this six months after you write code is not the best way
   of developing good software today. So the underlying challenge of this
   kata is this: how can we get into the habit of critically reviewing
   the code that we write, as we write it?&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>Maybe we could replace the word &quot;critically&quot; here with<br />
&quot;innocently&quot; to achieve a different but still beneficial effect?</p>

<p>I started out with a Commodore 64 myself. I still remember the weird<br />
feeling I had when I ran &quot;Eliza&quot; for the first time. It was<br />
magical and kind of spooky. I may have actually thought I was talking to an<br />
intelligent being. I spent an embarrassingly large amount of time in front<br />
of that program. I guess Eliza wasn&#8217;t nearly as mean as the kids at<br />
school&#8212;nor did it seem to be much less intelligent. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For centuries, Buddhists have practiced a meditation technique called<br />
Visualization. The practice involves reconstructing every minute detail of<br />
a complex Thangka painting (e.g. <a
href="http://www.tibetshop.com/gs363.html">www.tibetshop.com/gs363.html</a>)<br />
from memory in one&#8217;s mind. The ultimate aim is to be able to hold an<br />
entire complex image in your mind at once, as if actually looking at the<br />
painting.</p>
<p>
<p>As with many (if not all) of the Buddhist meditative practices, the goal of<br />
this meditation is to practice focusing and controlling the mind.<br />
Scientific studies have shown that Buddhist meditative practices such as<br />
visualization have a signficant physical effect on where and how activity<br />
occurs in the brain. Additionally, it has been proven that intense practice<br />
in various disciplines signficantly increases the physical development of<br />
the brain in areas associated with positive thought.(1) Mental practice and<br />
development is analogous to physical exercise, with your mental<br />
&quot;muscles&quot; getting materially stronger with practice.</p>
</p>
<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>
<p>(If you are new to the term &quot;Code Kata&quot;, visit Dave&#8217;s site:<br />
<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata</a>.<br />
This Kata will require more than one sitting. Start small and increase in<br />
complexity over time. Continue with a single piece of code until<br />
you&#8217;ve mastered it or until you see no value in continuing.)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Pick a piece of code that you consider to be of extremely high quality.<br />
Ideally, this should be sized somewhere between the huge (the Linux kernel<br />
source) and the tiny (&quot;Cookbook&quot; snippets). For maximum<br />
utilitarian benefit, find a piece of software that you would like to<br />
enhance your understanding of. Open source programmers might choose, for<br />
example, the standard library of their programming language of choice.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Find a quiet place where you won&#8217;t be disturbed. Start with a<br />
moderately small piece of your chosen code base and study it intensely for<br />
20 to 30 minutes. You can start out with as small a chunk as you like.<br />
After your period of study, sit back, close your eyes (if you like), relax,<br />
and try to reconstruct the code in your mind. You might start with classes<br />
(in an object oriented program), fill the classes out with methods and<br />
instance variables, and eventually fill out the method bodies. Follow the<br />
logical flow from one method to the next. Enumerate the classes, variables,<br />
and methods in your mind.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Alternatively, you could spend sessions trying to reconstruct a graphical<br />
representation of the code&#8212;perhaps <span class="caps">UML</span>. Class diagrams and sequence<br />
diagrams would probably be a good start, though converting source to <span class="caps">UML</span> in<br />
your head might prove to be harder than remembering the code itself. A mix<br />
of code and visual representation might be a good place to end up. Feel<br />
free to experiment and season to taste.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Set a time limit for the exercise. 10-15 minutes would probably be a good<br />
start. Adjust as your experience dictates. Try not to let your mind wander<br />
during the time that you have allotted. As other thoughts enter your mind<br />
(e.g. &quot;Why am I doing this? This is silly. What should I have for<br />
dinner?&quot;) push them gently away and focus on the code. (As the<br />
Buddhist medidators would probably add, we all get distracted. Don&#8217;t<br />
be distracted by the fact that you&#8217;re getting distracted. Don&#8217;t<br />
punish yourself. Just go back to the code.)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Slowly add more and more of the full code base as you practice in<br />
subsequent days and weeks. Add code one &quot;module&quot; at a time, until<br />
you eventually (if ever) are able to hold your entire chosen code base in<br />
your mind.</p>
</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
<p>There are two primary goals to this exercise, one with immediate visible<br />
benefit&#8212;the other with a potentially longer term effect:</p>
</p>
<h3>Immediate/Visible</h3>
<p>
<p>Great conductors commit entire symphonies to memory. That might be 30<br />
minutes worth of black dots written for potentially 100+ simultaneous<br />
(instrumental) voices. I&#8217;ve heard some say that it greatly enhances<br />
their ability to <b>hear</b> the piece. If these pieces happen to be the<br />
work of a &quot;master&quot;, what better way is there to stamp a piece of<br />
that master&#8217;s work on your mind?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In music, this has the very pragmatic side effect that a conductor can<br />
quickly and efficiently work with an orchestra that is playing a piece that<br />
the conductor has committed to memory. The same is true in software. No<br />
need to look up that function from the <span class="caps">API</span> documentation. And you&#8217;re<br />
more likely to find the &quot;optimal&quot; solution to a problem, if you<br />
are intimately familiar with the tools available to do the job. You can<br />
drive a screw into a board with a hammer, but if only you knew about that<br />
screw driver, life would be much easier.</p>
</p>
<h3>Longer Term/Esoteric</h3>
<p>
<p>Unless you have photographic memory, reconstructing large pieces of code in<br />
your mind is an extremely difficult thing to do. If you&#8217;re like me,<br />
you have trouble committing even small pieces to memory. This is like<br />
weight lifting for the mind. You will develop new &quot;muscles&quot; that<br />
you never knew you had. Your mind will find new ways to associate,<br />
generalize, and ultimately simplify the complexities of the software for<br />
you. Be warned that you might not see it or feel it after one<br />
attempt&#8212;or even 10. Another analogy from music: Do you think jazz<br />
improvisers actually think of the name and finger position of every note<br />
they play before they play it? The answer is &quot;no&quot;. Their minds<br />
can&#8217;t work that fast. The details get grouped into gestures and<br />
generalizations&#8212;most of them completely subconcious.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And, of course, if you believe the scientists and Buddhist scholars<br />
involved with the Mind and Life Institue (<a
href="http://www.mindandlife.org">www.mindandlife.org</a>), you may<br />
potentially develop your mental abilities in a way that would contribute to<br />
any activity requiring concentration, including the quest for happiness. :)</p>
</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are there pieces of code or styles of design that are easier to visualize<br />
than others?</li>
<li>What seems to drive your ability to hold certain pieces of code in your<br />
mind over others?</li>
<li>Do you think these drivers are the same for everyone, or do they vary by<br />
individual? Might this realization affect the way you write your own code?</li>
<li>What mental tricks might you subconciously be developing to manage this<br />
complexity?</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">suggested</a> that Google might have purchased <a href="http://www.pyra.com">Pyra Labs</a> in an effort to polish the excrement that &#8220;blogging&#8221; creates.<br />
<p><br />
I was pleased today to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">find out</a> that I might have been right.  It seems that Google may separate web log search results from everything else, as they&#8217;ve done with Usenet.<br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;m looking forward to the appearance of a &#8220;web logs&#8221; tab on google.com, both so I can occasionally click it, and so I can search for something and actually get some usable results back.  The only disappointing thing is that my site is much less likely to get amusing referrals from Google searches like &#8220;Iron Maiden Fan Club in Iraq&#8221; (I didn&#8217;t make that up, and it happened more than once).<br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;m not feeling as negative about &#8220;blogging&#8221; as I did in February, but I was still amused by the following quote from the Register article:<br />
<pre><br />
Recent research by Pew put the number of blog readers as opposed <br />
to writers, as &#8220;statistically insignificant&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, through dense and incestuous linking, results from blogs <br />
can drown out other sources. <br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is the last day of an almost year-and-a-half stay in Bangalore.  It&#8217;s weird to see the house emptying.  We&#8217;ve taken quite a few trips since we&#8217;ve been here, so we&#8217;re used to the feeling of packing and leaving.  But not to the feeling of leaving and knowing that we won&#8217;t be coming back.  I&#8217;ve always hated moving and always been somewhat sentimental about leaving a house.  This time, it&#8217;s a much stronger feeling, knowing that we&#8217;ll be on the other side of the world in a few days with no concrete plans to see India again.<br />
<p><br />
The previous week has been one &#8220;last&#8221; thing after the next.  Last Hindi lesson.  Last haircut from my friends Manjunath and Krishna at the Oberoi.  Last day in the office that I helped to select, build, and (hopefully) make a fabulous place for 250+ people to work.  Last time being forced to sing in front of the entire Bangalore staff (yes, I secretly enjoyed this). ;)  And, most recently, last idli/waada at the local darshani (Sree Lakshmi Venkateshwara).<br />
<p><br />
An example of the difference in the emotional bonds that Indian people develop versus those of Americans:  Two days ago, we ordered pizza from Pizza Hut to be delivered, because we had already started packing things up and didn&#8217;t have many options to prepare food at home.  When the delivery person came (Deepak), Kelly told him it was probably our last time ordering pizza from them since we were moving.  Last night around 9:30PM we were surprised by a visit from Deepak on his Pizza Hut bike.  He brought us a bouquet of flowers and told us he was going to miss us.  This wasn&#8217;t a gift from Pizza Hut (though, that in itself would have been a wonder).  This was a gift from Deepak.  He looked genuinely sad.  This is only <i>one</i> example of many from our last week here.  Were we as Americans ever like this?  If not, why not?  If so, why did we lose it?  Why are we so jaded?<br />
<p><br />
The movers will be here in under an hour to strip the house bare.  Then, we&#8217;ll spend our last few hours talking and playing chess with our driver and best friend, Ramesh, sweating in the heat and watching the cows, buffalo, and goats go by.<br />
<p><br />
I guess some of the sentimentality of the Indian people has rubbed off on me, and I think that&#8217;s a good thing.  Someone asked me last week what I was going to &#8220;take away&#8221; from this experience.  I think this is the big one.  It&#8217;s OK to care about people.  Not just a close, inner circle but anyone and everyone.  On my first trip to India, and experienced travel told me, &#8220;Rule number one: Don&#8217;t trust <i>anyone</i> in India&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve spent more time here than him now, and I can confidentally say that he&#8217;s wrong.<br />
<p><br />
Hamaare har Hindustani doston se yeh kehta hun:  Sab kuch ke liye, bahut bahut dhanyawad.  Nahi bhul jaaunga.<br />
<p><br />
<i>We&#8217;ll be traveling for basically a week.  We have to take breaks because the dogs can&#8217;t make a straight journey all the way home.  We&#8217;re flying into Chicago and will stay there for a day or two to recover from jet lag before the flight home.  So, if you don&#8217;t hear back from an email or don&#8217;t see us pop up on <span class="caps">AIM</span>, you&#8217;ll know why.</i></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just finished our last trip up North before we pack up and go home to Louisville.  We flew with Walter and Mary Ellen to<br />
Delhi, and then drove to Agra to see the Taj Mahal.  The first day in Agra, the Taj was closed.  So, we decided to<br />
take a walk through the neighborhoods surrounding the monument.  We made a lot of new friends.<br />
