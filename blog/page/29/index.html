  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">suggested</a> that Google might have purchased <a href="http://www.pyra.com">Pyra Labs</a> in an effort to polish the excrement that &#8220;blogging&#8221; creates.<br />
<p><br />
I was pleased today to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">find out</a> that I might have been right.  It seems that Google may separate web log search results from everything else, as they&#8217;ve done with Usenet.<br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;m looking forward to the appearance of a &#8220;web logs&#8221; tab on google.com, both so I can occasionally click it, and so I can search for something and actually get some usable results back.  The only disappointing thing is that my site is much less likely to get amusing referrals from Google searches like &#8220;Iron Maiden Fan Club in Iraq&#8221; (I didn&#8217;t make that up, and it happened more than once).<br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;m not feeling as negative about &#8220;blogging&#8221; as I did in February, but I was still amused by the following quote from the Register article:<br />
<pre><br />
Recent research by Pew put the number of blog readers as opposed <br />
to writers, as &#8220;statistically insignificant&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, through dense and incestuous linking, results from blogs <br />
can drown out other sources. <br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is the last day of an almost year-and-a-half stay in Bangalore.  It&#8217;s weird to see the house emptying.  We&#8217;ve taken quite a few trips since we&#8217;ve been here, so we&#8217;re used to the feeling of packing and leaving.  But not to the feeling of leaving and knowing that we won&#8217;t be coming back.  I&#8217;ve always hated moving and always been somewhat sentimental about leaving a house.  This time, it&#8217;s a much stronger feeling, knowing that we&#8217;ll be on the other side of the world in a few days with no concrete plans to see India again.<br />
<p><br />
The previous week has been one &#8220;last&#8221; thing after the next.  Last Hindi lesson.  Last haircut from my friends Manjunath and Krishna at the Oberoi.  Last day in the office that I helped to select, build, and (hopefully) make a fabulous place for 250+ people to work.  Last time being forced to sing in front of the entire Bangalore staff (yes, I secretly enjoyed this). ;)  And, most recently, last idli/waada at the local darshani (Sree Lakshmi Venkateshwara).<br />
<p><br />
An example of the difference in the emotional bonds that Indian people develop versus those of Americans:  Two days ago, we ordered pizza from Pizza Hut to be delivered, because we had already started packing things up and didn&#8217;t have many options to prepare food at home.  When the delivery person came (Deepak), Kelly told him it was probably our last time ordering pizza from them since we were moving.  Last night around 9:30PM we were surprised by a visit from Deepak on his Pizza Hut bike.  He brought us a bouquet of flowers and told us he was going to miss us.  This wasn&#8217;t a gift from Pizza Hut (though, that in itself would have been a wonder).  This was a gift from Deepak.  He looked genuinely sad.  This is only <i>one</i> example of many from our last week here.  Were we as Americans ever like this?  If not, why not?  If so, why did we lose it?  Why are we so jaded?<br />
<p><br />
The movers will be here in under an hour to strip the house bare.  Then, we&#8217;ll spend our last few hours talking and playing chess with our driver and best friend, Ramesh, sweating in the heat and watching the cows, buffalo, and goats go by.<br />
<p><br />
I guess some of the sentimentality of the Indian people has rubbed off on me, and I think that&#8217;s a good thing.  Someone asked me last week what I was going to &#8220;take away&#8221; from this experience.  I think this is the big one.  It&#8217;s OK to care about people.  Not just a close, inner circle but anyone and everyone.  On my first trip to India, and experienced travel told me, &#8220;Rule number one: Don&#8217;t trust <i>anyone</i> in India&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve spent more time here than him now, and I can confidentally say that he&#8217;s wrong.<br />
<p><br />
Hamaare har Hindustani doston se yeh kehta hun:  Sab kuch ke liye, bahut bahut dhanyawad.  Nahi bhul jaaunga.<br />
<p><br />
<i>We&#8217;ll be traveling for basically a week.  We have to take breaks because the dogs can&#8217;t make a straight journey all the way home.  We&#8217;re flying into Chicago and will stay there for a day or two to recover from jet lag before the flight home.  So, if you don&#8217;t hear back from an email or don&#8217;t see us pop up on <span class="caps">AIM</span>, you&#8217;ll know why.</i></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just switched to using Phoenix (<a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix">www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix</a>)<br />
as my primary browser, and decided to go hunting for some extensions last<br />
night. I hit gold: Linky (<a
href="http://linky.mozdev.org/">linky.mozdev.org/</a>), the Mozilla/Phoenix<br />
extension of my dreams.</p>
<p>
<p>With Linky, you can&#8212;among other things&#8212;select an area of text<br />
and open any selected links in separate browser tabs. And, with Phoenix,<br />
the default new-tab behaviour is to open each tab in the background. So,<br />
when I start my browsing sessions now, I can select the links down the<br />
right-hand side of this page and&#8212;with one command&#8212;open them all<br />
simultaneously in separate tabs. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for an<br />
extension to better match my browsing behaviour. (I actually use my own<br />
website as a bookmark list for sites I regularly visit).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I might be the only person I know who would get excited about this feature,<br />
but I thought I&#8217;d share it just in case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past two days, I&#8217;ve been focusing my free time on programming &#8220;practice&#8221; (<a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Bowling.html">Bowling</a>). As I predicted, I&#8217;ve created some truly hideous stuff.  Something I <b>hadn&#8217;t</b> predicted is that in many cases, I&#8217;ve produced code that doesn&#8217;t even work&#8212;and, I can&#8217;t <i>make</i> it work.  At first, I felt bad about this, but I&#8217;m starting to think that it&#8217;s not only acceptable but expected.<br />
<p><br />
As a musician, especially after you get over the inevitably ugly sounds of first learning an instrument, it&#8217;s very tempting to &#8220;practice&#8221; things that already sound good.  For example, I became quite skilled at exploiting the harmonic overtones of the saxophone.  I could play tunes almost regardless of which buttons I pressed on the horn.  Since I was so good at this&#8212;and it felt good to be so good at it&#8212;I would sometimes find myself &#8220;playing&#8221; with harmonics instead of &#8220;practicing&#8221;.  It was especially easy to subconciously justify because many saxophonists <strong>aren&#8217;t</strong> good at this technique.  So, I had the feeling I was &#8220;practicing&#8221; something difficult.  In truth, I was just playing&#8212;not practicing.<br />
<p><br />
So, what does it mean that I have tried to write programs in my practice sessions that I&#8217;ve been unable to complete?  It means that I&#8217;ve been trying to do things that are either beyond my grasp or beyond the grasp of the language that I&#8217;m using.  That&#8217;s a Good Thing.  I&#8217;m pushing my own limits, or &#8220;Finding The Box&#8221;, as the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Pragmatic Programmers</a> say.<br />
<p><br />
If you&#8217;re following this programming-practice thread and trying to make something of it, beware of too many successes.  If the exercises make you &#8220;look bad&#8221;, you&#8217;re probably headed in the right direction.</p></div>

<a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2003/03/24#march24-2">BM</a><br />
], I thought I would pull together a few relevant old links on an old topic.  But, first&#8230;<br />
<p><br />
In the article I <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/HundredYearLanguage.rdoc">mentioned yesterday</a>, Paul Graham has the following to say about Object Oriented programming:<br />
<pre><br />
    I don&#8217;t predict the demise of object-oriented programming, by the way. <br />
    Though I don&#8217;t think it has much to offer good programmers, except in <br />
    certain specialized domains, it is irresistible to large organizations. <br />
    Object-oriented programming offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti <br />
    code. It lets you accrete programs as a series of patches.<br />
</pre><br />
Though I&#8217;m not sure if I <i>completely</i> agree with him, I always like to see someone intelligent questioning an accepted norm.  He&#8217;s basically saying that OO is a crutch that allows bad programming to sustain itself.  This statement caused me to re-examine how much I rely on the OO crutch.<br />
<p><br />
Back to &#8220;practice&#8221;&#8230;If I <i>do</i> indeed use OO as a crutch, I should probably include non-OO programming in my practice routines.  I&#8217;m once again reminded of a parallel to my studies in music.  I once had an improvisation teacher who asked me to play a 3 minute improvised piece of music using only the note G.  I didn&#8217;t even know where to start at first (besides the obvious&#8212;G).  It was an amazingly difficult challenge to create something &#8220;musical&#8221; with this level of constraint.  That was the point, of course.  Sans-OO programming poses a similar, though admittedly less difficult, challenge for me.<br />
<p><br />
As I started thinking of a suitable programming exercise, I was reminded of Bob Martin and Bob Koss&#8217;s <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/xpepisode.htm">bowling score exercise</a>.  My first exposure to it was at the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/courses/xpImmersion">eXtreme Programming Immersion</a>.  The purpose was to show how test driven design can lead to simpler, more elegant solutions than upfront design.  Many of the objects that you would assume are necessary never get created in the top-down test-first approach (at least in Bob and Bob&#8217;s version).<br />
<p><br />
I later <a href="http://www.rubygarden.org/article.php?sid=38">posted on RubyGarden</a> when Leo Scott and Wayne Conrad produced their own <a href="http://www.yagni.com/cgi-bin/pywiki?BowlingScores">version</a> of the bowling score program in Ruby.  It was interesting to see how their experience differed from The Bobs&#8217; and how the program changed with a straight port to Ruby.  <br />
<p><br />
When Wayne questioned whether the code could have been shorter if they knew Ruby better, Dave posted the <a href="http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?Dave_Bowling_Solution">this fascinating piece of minimalism</a>.  14 lines, and it passed all of the original tests.<br />
<p><br />
Just when I thought it couldn&#8217;t get any stranger than Dave&#8217;s version, I ran across <a href="http://www.c2.com">Ward Cunningham&#8217;s</a> Perl-based solution, which consists almost entirely of regular expressions.  He has a <a href="http://c2.com/doc/bowl/">full writeup</a> on his web site.<br />
<p><br />
These are all basically transcripts of programmers&#8217; practice sessions, with Dave&#8217;s and Ward&#8217;s each being a different study on constraints.  Dave&#8217;s constraint was size.  Ward&#8217;s was the focus on regular expressions.  Eliminating explicit use of OO in an OO language might be another (less interesting) one.  The simple idea of programming with self-imposed constraints leads to a wealth of potential &#8220;Code Kata&#8221; ideas.  It&#8217;s like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.<br />
<p><br />
What other methods or resources do we take for granted while programming?  What other assumptions can we question about what makes &#8220;good&#8221; style?  This is the type of question I&#8217;ll ask myself when I next sit down to &#8220;practice&#8221;.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll end up generating something hideous as a result, but hopefully I&#8217;ll learn something too.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished reading Paul Graham&#8217;s fascinating essay, &quot;The<br />
Hundred-Year Language&quot; (<a
href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html</a>).<br />
Having recently spent some time on this topic myself, it was really<br />
interesting to read his views on the evolution of programming languages and<br />
the direction that he thinks things will move in the next century.</p>
<p>
<p>In my recent post on <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/LanguageEvolution.html,v">LanguageEvolution</a>,<br />
I mentioned that (spoken/written) language evolution is influenced by<br />
social factors. Language features suggesting affluence often win the<br />
evolutionary fight as speakers strive to sound more &quot;cultured&quot; or<br />
intelligent. Paul Graham has the following to say about programming<br />
language research:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   Research imposes constraining caste restrictions. In any academic field
   there are topics that are ok to work on and others that aren't.
   Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable and forbidden topics
   is usually based on how intellectual the work sounds when described
   in research papers, rather than how important it is for
   getting good results.
</pre>
<p>
<p>So, social factors seem to be affecting language designers as well. If it<br />
doesn&#8217;t show &quot;intellectual affluence&quot;, it&#8217;s<br />
apparently (according to Graham) not likely to show up in research. In this<br />
same section, Graham says that he is excited that many new languages are<br />
being created by &quot;hackers&quot; these days (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.)<br />
and that there are some innovative ideas coming out of these languages. In<br />
the context of computing history, this represents a step toward empowerment<br />
on a wider scale. Not quite &quot;the masses&quot;, but closer.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re at all interested in this kind of thing, the full article<br />
is definitely worth a read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What if human languages didn&#8217;t evolve as they do, but instead, all language change was centralized and controlled by expert linguists?  Would we be able to communicate with even half the level of expressiveness and creativity that we do now?  I don&#8217;t know of any natural languages whose complete vocabularies and rule-sets have been successfully codified and documented.  Sure, we have dictionaries and grammar books, but ultimately these serve only as a starting point from which experience and learning have to fill in the gaps.  So far, natural language has proven to be too expressive and complex to, for example, allow us to create computer programs capable of parsing and understanding it.<br />
<P><br />
I started thinking a lot about this after reading Steven Pinker&#8217;s <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&isbn=0060958332&TXT=Y&itm=1">The Language Instinct</a>, followed by <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&isbn=0060958405&itm=1">Words and Rules</a>.  While in Barcelona, I was lucky enough to discover and purchase a copy of Jean Aitchison&#8217;s excellent exploration of language evolution, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/results.asp?TTL=Language+Change+Progress+or+Decay&userid=2TLSUZ2VRE">Language Change: Progress or Decay?</a>.  Her thesis is that language change represents both progress <i>and</i> decay, and that it&#8217;s a natural process which should be no more questionable than the evolution of a species.<br />
<p><br />
Some of the major points from <span class="caps">LCP</span>:oD &#8211; <br />
<ul><br />
<li>Language change is, like most natural phenomena, decentralized in nature.  Attempts, such as those made by the French government, to &#8220;command and control&#8221; language evolution have proven to be futile.<br />
<li>Change usually creeps in as an exploitation of weakness in a language.  Examples are certain combinations of sounds in varieties of the English language which have combined into one <i>(jump-ed &#8594; jump&#8217;d)</i>, morphed <i>(spoilt &#8594; spoiled)</i>, or disappeared completely over time <i>(Cockney&#8217;s bottom &#8594; bo&#8217;om)</i>.<br />
<li>Most language changes beget compression and increased efficiency for the speaker.<br />
<li>Once a change is introduced, its spread is often influenced by social factors.  For example, a manner of speech which suggests a higher social status will spread quickly in middle and lower class communities.<br />
<li>While language change is natural and inevitable, it is sometimes socially undesirable.  Excessive change may be inconvenient if it linguistically divides two or more communities that were once able to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>What if computer programming languages <i>could</i> evolve, and progress in programming language technology <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> centralized and controlled by expert computer scientists?  How much more expressively and efficiently could we communicate with computers&#8212;and with the programmers who have to read and modify our code?<br />
<p><br />
There is, of course, the matter of practical reality getting in the way of something like this immediately happening.  The biggest challenge is that we have to communicate both with humans <i>and</i> with computers.  If computers were smart enough to handle an ever-evolving language, we probably wouldn&#8217;t still have a field of research called Computational Linguistics.<br />
<p><br />
How could you make evolutionary program language &#8220;design&#8221; work?  The easiest answer is to say that it already does&#8230;to some extent.  Bjarne Stroustrup once <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201700735/qid=1049645974/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/002-9394931-1863239">said</a> that:<br />
<pre><br />
&#8220;Library design is language design&#8221;<br />
</pre><br />
By this, he meant that APIs are like little languages that represent a specific domain.  Each has its own &#8220;manner of speech&#8221;, so to speak.  If this is true, then you could easily see how the same compression, efficiency and social status drivers that affect language change could impact the way APIs are designed or even how programming styles differ from programmer to programmer.<br />
<p><br />
You can be sure that, when designing <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz</a> never directly intended for his language to lead to the following manner of programming:<br />
<pre><br />
a=&#8216;p=0;t=&quot;&quot;*30000;&#8217;;$&lt;.each_byte{|c|a&lt;&lt;({?&gt;=&gt;&quot;p+=1;&#8220;,?&lt;=&gt;&#8221;p-=1;&quot;,?<ins>=&gt; &quot;t[p]</ins>=1;<br />
&#8220;,?-=&gt;&#8221;t[p]-=1;&#8220;,?[=&gt;&#8221;while t[p]&gt;0;&#8220;,?]=&gt;&#8221;end;&#8220;,?.=&gt;&#8221;putc t[p];<br />
&#8220;, ?,=&gt;&#8221;t[p]=<span class="caps">STDIN</span>.getc||0;&#8220;}||&#8221;&#8220;)};eval a<br />
</pre><br />
And, there&#8217;s definitely a big difference between this code snippet and the following example of how to create a sidebar in the (also Ruby-based) &#8221;http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog&quot;&gt;software</a> that powers this website:<br />
<pre><br />
LinkHolder.new(&#8220;Some Links&#8221;,<br />
        &#8220;http://www.rubycentral.org&#8221;          =&gt; &#8220;Ruby Central&#8221;,<br />
        &#8220;http://www.chadfowler.com&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;Chad Fowler&#8221;,<br />
	&#8220;http://languagehat.blogspot.com&#8221;              =&gt; &#8220;Artima&#8221;<br />
)<br />
</pre><br />
They&#8217;re both Ruby, but the similarities stop there.  I&#8217;d go so far as to say that the first program (which happens to be an <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/ABetterOok.rdoc">interpreter</a> for an obfuscated programming language) is no more immediately understandable to the average Ruby programmer than Spanish is to the average English speaker.  Though you might not go so far as to say these are two different <i>languages</i>, it wouldn&#8217;t be too far off base to think of them as two different <i>dialects</i>.  It would be interesting to know how much <span class="caps">API</span> design and dominant programming style affect the designers of languages and ultimately, though indirectly, set the future direction of programming language design.  Maybe there is a touch of evolution indirectly guiding our language designs.<br />
<p><br />
As I said, the &#8220;Library design is language design&#8221; argument gives us an easy answer.  We see in its evolution the same kind of subtle innovation that we see in spoken language.  But, the world of computing is rarely characterized as being a breeding ground for <i>subtle</i> innovation.<br />
<p><br />
In a <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a/3369">recent interview</a>, Alan Kay, the inventor of Smalltalk, said that &#8220;People today aren&#8217;t doing a lot of work to move programming to its next phase.&#8221;  He&#8217;s disappointed to see that innovations he and his team made in the early 70s <i>still</i> seem &#8220;modern&#8221; today.  Similarly, at MIT&#8217;s <a href="http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/">Lightweight Languages Workshop 2002</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s Todd Proebsting <a href="http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/talks/proebsting.ppt">argued</a> that the industry needs to start looking at &#8220;Disruptive Programming Language Technologies&#8221; (read: non-linear innovation) and stop focusing on optimization (beating) of the same old paradigm (near-dead horse).<br />
<p><br />
So, maybe there&#8217;s something to be said for changing the way we go about designing programming languages.<br />
<p><br />
Having said all this, I still don&#8217;t have much of an idea of how to overcome the practical problems of decentralized programming language evolution.  But, here are a few thoughts for starters:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><i>Learn from our syntax errors.</i>  What are the most common mistakes that programmers make?  Why?  In some cases, it might be carelessness, but if you could capture all of the mistakes made in the world of, for example, Java programming, there might be some patterns that show us a &#8220;weakness&#8221; that could be exploited.  If you think about it, programming errors are an important source of feedback to the language designer that are currently being lost by the ton each day.  How different might Java look if Sun could just see how often I screw up my Java programs because of all of those damned parentheses I generate having to type-cast everything?<br />
<li><i>Bring language design to the masses</i> in the same way that the Quake engine brought 3D game design to thousands of college freshman with too much free time.  Surely there has to be a more user-friendly tool for language implementation than Bison or Antlr.    Maybe we&#8217;ll look back 15 years from now and laugh about how hard it used to be to make a new language in the same way that we look back now and laugh about how hard it used to be to do what Excel makes simple today.<br />
<li><i>Actually build an adaptive interpreter or compiler.</i>  By this, I mean an interpreter that will learn from programmers&#8217; mistakes and adapt to nuances in programmers&#8217; styles.  <a href="http://www.asd.k12.ak.us/Schools/Bartlett/academics/HIP/Gumptionology/Pages/Value_rigidity.html">Value rigidty</a> mixed with a healthy respect for reality make this one pretty tough to swallow, but as Proebsting says in his &#8220;Disruptive Programming Language Technologies&#8221; talk (not in so many words), the disruptive technologies of the future are the ones that seem ridiculous to us now.</p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>It would take someone a lot smarter and more patient than me to actually do anything with these ideas.  But, (as Jean Aitchison puts it) &#8220;social undesirability&#8221; aside, the idea of programming in Pidgin Java or SmallPerl# Creole appeals to me in an exciting and indescribable way.<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While surfing through my home directory on my laptop today, I realized that I have started many more since-abandoned (and forgotten) projects than I thought.  In February, I post <a href="/index.cgi/AttentionSpanChallenged.html">an explanation</a> of why this happens.  <br />
<p><br />
I looked through some of the code I had written and was alarmed to see that some of it actually works.  It would be a shame to let it be <i>completely</i> forgotten and go to permanent waste, so I&#8217;ve taken a step toward preserving the many project beginnings that I create.<br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;ve decided that all future potential throw-away projects will, instead of living on a <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository on my local PC, be maintained in a centralized <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository, located <a href="/viewcvs.cgi">here</a>.<br />
<p><br />
If you browse there now, you&#8217;ll see <a href="/viewcvs.cgi/jvm_analysis">today&#8217;s distraction</a>.  I&#8217;ve started adapting some of the code from <a href="http://www.namikilab.tuat.ac.jp/~sasada/prog/rava.html">Rava</a> (an attempt at a ruby-based Java Virtual Machine&#8212;no English documentation as far as I can tell) in an effort to create an automated code-review/analysis tool for Java projects.  I know such tools already exist, but they&#8217;re usually expensive and require you to write Java code or use a feature-limited <span class="caps">GUI</span> to create new rules.  I&#8217;m excited about the potential of expressing code review rules in a simple Ruby-based <span class="caps">API</span>-cum-domain-language.  <br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;ve been gradually refactoring Rava and removing things I don&#8217;t need over the course of the day.  So far, I haven&#8217;t added anything new, though it&#8217;s becoming less and less recognizable as Rava as the day moves on.  Another couple of hours&#8217; work should yield some preliminary code review functionality.  As of now, it just reads class files.  It really could use some unit tests, too.  This is the kind of thing that can quickly become read-only without tests.<br />
<p><br />
Sometime soon, I&#8217;ll try to get around to cleaning up the various other almost-projects sitting on my laptop and desktop PCs and import all of them.  Unfortunately, our internet connection is so dreadfully slow here in India that it&#8217;s a huge pain to check things in and out from my new repository.  Another month more, and we&#8217;ll be back to blazingly fast internet access that I&#8217;ll never take for granted again.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past week, I&#8217;ve been playing around with <span class="caps">RSS</span> news<br />
aggregators. I think I&#8217;ve settled (for now) on Spaces (<a
href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com">www.dynamicobjects.com</a>).<br />
It&#8217;s actually a full email client/<span class="caps">PIM</span> as well as a news aggregator.<br />
What I really like about it is that the news posts trail in as messages in<br />
your inbox along with the actual emails. It&#8217;s nice to only have to<br />
look one place when I turn on my computer. And, when I search the messages<br />
in my inbox, it takes into account almost any online material I&#8217;m<br />
likely to have been reading.</p>
<p>
<p>Now, I just have to train myself not to open up my web browser and start<br />
visiting the sites for which I now <b>know</b> there are no updates. It<br />
sounds ridiculous, but I&#8217;ve been doing it consistently. This confirms<br />
the habitual nature of my internet-browsing behaviour.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also still been using AgentFrank (<a
href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank">www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank</a>)<br />
in combination with the aggregators. What I would <b>love</b> now is<br />
integration between something like Spaces and something like AgentFrank.<br />
I&#8217;m sure this idea would make a lot of people ill (especially the<br />
paranoid), but I would like for an AgentFrankish thing to discover what<br />
I&#8217;m looking at (repeatedly or based on semantic closeness to things I<br />
look at repeatedly) and then start pulling new items into a Spaces-esque<br />
aggregator without my asking it to. AgentFrank helps me to stop forgetting<br />
the interesting sites I find, and Spaces helps me to remember (or, more<br />
correctly, to not <b>have</b> to remember) to look at the interesting sites<br />
I know about. The combination of the two could be really powerful for a<br />
scatter-brained guy like me.</p>
