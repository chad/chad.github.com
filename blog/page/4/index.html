  <div class="entry-content"><p>I travel a lot. Not the most of anyone I know, but enough to have found myself inconvenienced plenty of times and to have learned ways to make life more comfortable on the road. Here are a few tips that I&#8217;ve collected over time (or most recently <a href="http://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/24098334515">via twitter</a>). Hopefully they&#8217;ll come in handy to others.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Always carry a power strip in your suitcase. Great for international trips to avoid having to buy multiple adapters. But even in your home country, hotels can be really bad about providing enough outlets. I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9YN2M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chadfowcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000F9YN2M">one of these</a> which fits nicely in a suitcase or laptop bag without taking up too much room.</li>
	<li>If you like coffee or tea, bring your own favorite brand of instant mix. I&#8217;m not a big Starbucks coffee fan, but their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P5LFJI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chadfowcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002P5LFJI">Via</a> product is the best tasting instant coffee I&#8217;ve ever had and beats the coffee available in any hotel room anywhere. When you&#8217;re trying to beat jet lag, having something better than the usual hotel swill is very welcome.</li>
	<li>Considering getting a portable <span class="caps">WIFI</span> router. Many of the hotels I stay in only provide ethernet connections, which would otherwise tether me to a desk. Given how much work I do at my computer, being able to sit where ever I like in the room is important. I also use the <span class="caps">WIFI</span> router to connect multiple devices without having to (potentially) pay multiple times for internet access. We have an old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015YJOK2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chadfowcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0015YJOK2">airport express</a> which we use for this purpose.</li>
	<li>Be careful about <span class="caps">SMS</span> messages. Even if your phone works overseas, you can easily amass a ridiculous cell phone bill from sending or receiving <span class="caps">SMS</span> messages. One friend accidentally ended up with a $600 bill from text messages alone after a trip overseas. It&#8217;s not unusual for each text message to cost $0.50 or more.</li>
	<li>Rent a cell phone and/or internet access device when traveling internationally. As an example, in Japan&#8217;s Narita airport you can easily rent a portable <span class="caps">WIFI</span> access point which provides internet access via the cellular network right in the arrivals area. On my last trip, I passed the time on a bus video chatting with my wife. Another cell phone option is to bring an unlocked phone and buy a pre-paid <span class="caps">SIM</span> card for it in your destination country.</li>
	<li>Carry your own meal replacement bars.  You never know when you&#8217;re going to find yourself stuck on a tarmac starving or inconveniently moving from flight to flight during meal times.  Keeping your eating on schedule helps significantly with jet lag, but it also just helps you not feel terrible as you travel.  <a href="http://twitter.com/objo">Joe O&#8217;Brien</a> suggests <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00336EXQU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chadfowcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00336EXQU">Clif Bars</a>. Personally I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RD38D0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chadfowcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001RD38D0"><span class="caps">GNC</span> brand protein bars</a>.</li>
	<li>Always keep a spare set of clothes in your carry-on luggage if you&#8217;re checking bags. I don&#8217;t do this one, but I should. I spent several days freezing in the winter in Poland a couple of years ago because not only did I not have extra clothes in my carry-on but I checked my coat to avoid having to lug it around on the flights. Big mistake. Polish Air lost my suitcase and didn&#8217;t get it to me until nearly the end of the trip.</li>
	<li>Use something like <a href="http://tripit.com">Tripit</a> to consolidate your itinerary info then print it out.</li>
	<li>Leave your international travel supplies packed. For example, there&#8217;s no reason to take your travel power adapter, <span class="caps">WIFI</span> router, or international power supplies out of your suitcase if you always use the same luggage. When I went to Japan recently I ended up tearing the grounding pin out of my Macbook Pro power cable so I could plug it into the Japanese outlets. <span class="caps">BTW</span>, I don&#8217;t recommend doing that.</li>
	<li>Especially for really long flights, drink a lot of water. Air travel can dehydrate you. The effect of drinking water is subtle but magical. You&#8217;ll feel <em>much</em> better if you make yourself do it.</li>
	<li>Spend a significant amount of time outside in the sunlight on your first and second days in a new time zone. Go for a walk, breathe a lot of fresh air, maybe even do some outside exercise. Natural light and fresh air are two of the best tools for beating jet lag.</li>
	<li>Consider traveling light and not checking any bags. Saves time and is safer than checking luggage (see my Poland story above). I confess I still don&#8217;t usually do this but I should.</li>
	<li>If you fly any significant amount at all, stick with one airline and record the miles. I get free upgrades on many domestic flights and some international flights simply because I fly United all the time.</li>
	<li>Use <a href="http://seatguru.com">http://seatguru.com</a> to pick your seats. I&#8217;ve been using it since <a href="http://pragprog.com">Dave Thomas</a> told me about it several years ago and I&#8217;ve more than once saved myself from an undesirable seat that I otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have known about until I boarded.  When you&#8217;re going to be stuck in the same spot for 5 hours, you don&#8217;t want to be e.g. wedged into the wall in a seat that doesn&#8217;t recline.</li>
	<li>Another one from Dave Thomas: Start living in the destination timezone when you get on the plane. When you arrive, no sleeping until at least 8pm local. I&#8217;m going to New York tonight and I let myself get up at 5AM <span class="caps">MDT</span> this morning since I knew it was 7AM <span class="caps">EDT</span>. I sometimes take it to the extreme, adjusting a few days early if I know I&#8217;m going to have trouble waking up for work in the new time zone. <a href="http://twitter.com/david_a_black">David Black</a> says he can&#8217;t manage to stay awake until 8PM when traveling east, so he limits himself to a 1.5 hour nap. I can&#8217;t limit myself to a 1.5 hour nap so I avoid sleeping at all.</li>
	<li>If you have any aptitude for language learning at all, you&#8217;d be surprised how easy it is to learn a few basic phrases. Spend a short amount of time on the plane learning some key phrases in your destination country. If the country has a different alphabet than the one you&#8217;re used to, don&#8217;t assume it will be too hard to learn. I learned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1880656183?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chadfowcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1880656183">Hiragana and much of Katakana</a> for a recent Japan trip and instantly found it useful. Even though I would misread some things, it came in handy for me. When in South India, it took me two days to learn how to phonetically read Kannada.</li>
	<li>If you&#8217;re going to be shopping, take a bigger suitcase than you need. Don&#8217;t fill it on the way there so you can fill it on the way back. Another option is to buy a cheap duffle bag and fill it with dirty clothes for the trip back using your main suitcase for your purchased items.</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t fold your clothes. If you roll them, they take less room in your luggage.</li>
	<li>Scan your travel documents and upload them to a web site somewhere that will be easy to get to while you&#8217;re traveling.</li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/imf">Ian McFarland</a> suggests: &#8220;Keeping all your key docs in a clear plastic folder helps a ton. Tripit itinerary, passport photocopies, any paper tickets&#8221;, etc. I haven&#8217;t done that before but it&#8217;s a great idea.</li>
	<li>David Black suggests that if you wear glasses, bring an eyeglass screwdriver. I had an eyeglass malfunction in Hungary once and it took two days to find a screwdriver to fix them (busy work schedule, unfamiliar with the area, etc.). The world looked lopsided for two days. Very annoying.</li>
	<li>Choose your flight schedules carefully. I personally like to plan to get to my destination fairly early. Even for domestic trips, I&#8217;d rather schedule myself to get in at 5PM and sit around with nothing to do than schedule an 11PM arrival, risking a delay and an unwanted late night.  <a href="http://twitter.com/copiousfreetime">Jeremy Hinegardner</a>  also suggests minimum 2 hour layovers. Delays happen and a longer layover is like an insurance policy. You pay a little every trip to avoid paying a lot when you really really don&#8217;t want to.</li>
	<li>Also from Jeremy, in his own words: &#8220;Travel problems: don&#8217;t get pissy. There are 2 people who care about it, you, and the person helping you. One of them can stop.&#8221; Wise.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve collected travel advice from a lot of people. Most of it is common sense, but if I forgot to mention someone, my apologies. Here are the people whose ideas I took from Twitter today (thanks all!):</p>

  <div class="entry-content">The following is my real time transcription of the translation of <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Matz&#8217;s</a> speech at <a href="http://www.rubyworld-conf.org">Ruby World 2010</a>.  I was typing as fast as I could while he spoke, and I probably made some mistakes. I might have left out some words or sentences. If anything doesn&#8217;t make sense, assume it&#8217;s my fault and not Matsumoto-san&#8217;s. Anyway, I enjoyed Matz&#8217;s keynote and thought other English speakers might like a chance to see what he said.
<h2>I&#8217;m Matsumoto</h2>
<p>I Started Ruby in 1993 at NaCL:http://www.netlab.jp/. When I joined the company after graduating from college, I didn&#8217;t have much to do at the time. I was not fired fortunately. But I had plenty of time so I started to work on Ruby as a side project.</p>
<p>So at the time, there was <span class="caps">ONE</span> user of Ruby. Then I started to develop Ruby with some other friends.</p>
<p>In 1995, Ruby was released and distributed over the internet for general use. At the time, people on usenet got interested in Ruby and gave me some feedback. Also we used a mailing list to distribute information on Ruby.</p>
<p>So within days, about 200 people got involved. So in 1995, the number of people who knew something about Ruby was about 200.</p>
<p>Even after that, Ruby was known to a relatively limited number of people.</p>
<p>Then in 1999, I published a book called Object Oriented Scripting with Ruby. This was the first book on Ruby. It&#8217;s only natural. Who else is going to write a book on Ruby, right??</p>
<p>At the time, this sold pretty well. Cumulatively, we sold almost 20,000 copies. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m allowed to discuss this number. Probably it&#8217;s only 17,000 in real numbers. This was in Japanese, so Ruby was known to the whole nation. So in 1999, Ruby was known to a lot more people. More engineers and programmers knew about the language.</p>
<p>I started to hear from many people that they knew about Ruby.</p>
<p>In year 2000, <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby">a book in English</a> was published.  Many people in the world came to know about Ruby.</p>
<p>Then in 2004, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> was released. Of course, most people know about this Web application framework. Ruby on Rails is very productive compared to competing frameworks in other languages.  There was an active discussion on the comparison of performance. It was welcomed by many people. We estimate that the number of users grew to 100,000 people in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2008, US-based Gartner released a survey. In the report, Gartner estimated that the total number of Ruby users reached 1,000,000. This was a huge number as you can see.</p>
<p>In the same report, the reporter predicted that in five years (2013)  the total number of users would be 4,000,000.  Ruby is open source. You don&#8217;t have to pay anything to use it. You just download it. It is therefore very difficult to know how many people are using it. I created Ruby myself and I don&#8217;t know how many people are using it, so I&#8217;m not sure how Gartner reached their conclusion.  But anyway, 4,000,000 people are predicted to be using Ruby in 2013.</p>
<p>So in 20 years, this project which started with one person may have increased from 1 to 4,000,000 users. This is beyond the normal growth rate of a technology.</p>
<p>This period of Ruby&#8217;s popularity was due to the popularity of Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>There is a ccompany called <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/">Tiobe Software</a> which is a software company in the US. Their <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Tiobe Index</a> rates the popularity of programming languages using Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and other search engines to rate the popularity of languages on the internet. Back in 2009, according to Tiobe index, Ruby was ranked #10. And in 2008, it was ranked #9.</p>
<p>In this year, 2010, it was demoted to #12.</p>
<p>You may have a concern about the future of Ruby, but if you drill down deeper, you will see: objective-c is getting more popular, driven by iPad, iPod, etc. development. Objective-C is required.  So it jumped form 42 to 11.  And Go by Google was released in April of last year. So where it didn&#8217;t exist previously it jumped up to #15.</p>
<p>As you can see, Ruby represents 2.221% of programming language references according to Tiobe.  That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t have a concern about this.</p>
<p>But this marks a very interesting symptom. The end of the ruby &#8220;bubble&#8221;. When I joined the company, the bubble economy was still there. Then it collapsed and caused a lot of trouble. A &#8220;bubble&#8221; is not sustainable. Bubbles are therefore undesirable.</p>
<p>There are many comedians and musicians named as &#8220;one-hit wonders&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want Ruby to become that.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of a programming language is pretty long. Fortran was created in the 1950s. I want Ruby to be like this. That&#8217;s why this presentation is called &#8220;Sustainable Ruby&#8221;.  The question is how to maintain Ruby&#8217;s high level of quality and the high level of quality of the people.</p>
<p>So in order to implement &#8220;sustainable ruby&#8221;, we must first discuss the benefit of Ruby.  Benefit is very important for Ruby to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Benefit #1: Productivity. One of the reasons that Ruby is quite popular is that its productivity is quite high. An embodiment of this is Ruby on Rails. When Rails was released, it was often cited that people would say that Rails had 10x productivity over java.  Ruby developers didn&#8217;t really believe this, but a specific developer in the US wrote an article saying that he felt that <span class="caps">HIS</span> productivity over Java when switching to Rails was 10&#215;.  In 2005 and 2006, this one sentence caused a lot of arguments and discussion.</p>
<p>After several years of discussion and usage of Ruby on Rails, it may not be 10x but there are many cases where you can enjoy the productivity of Ruby on Rails over Java.</p>
<p>Also, another example of how Rails is productive is that it can take only 15 minutes to develop a web application. In 2004 at a Brazilian conference, David Heinemeier Hansson demonstrated web application development using Ruby on Rails. Without any preparation, no design, no database, he started to create a blog application. You could create articles, list them, etc. He created this application in 15 minutes. In 2004, creating an application in 15 minutes it was astonishing.  It was great marketing to do that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a software engineer and I&#8217;m not very interested in marketing. But that video was a huge contributor to making Ruby on Rails popular. Ruby itself didn&#8217;t have any marketing, but Ruby on Rails promoted Ruby as well.</p>
<p>Was the Rails framework the sole reason behind the productivity boost when using it? I don&#8217;t think so. Ruby itself also makes the productivity possible.</p>
<p>Post-Rails frameworks.<br />
  Merb<br />
  Sinatra<br />
  Ramaze<br />
  Rails 3</p>
<p>Merb was emerging as a post-Rails framework, but it was quite unique in open software. Merb and Rails jointly created a new framework in the form of Rails 3. Also, Rails 3 is inheriting some of the Merb characteristics. Totally new framework by combining/merging different frameworks.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve been talking about the benefits that Ruby can provide in order to make Ruby sustainable.</p>
<p>The second element is the Potential the language can demonstrate. Now we have the technology and the technology is convenient and we can create some benefits. But we need to have potential in the Language for people to make investment.</p>
<p>Around Ruby we have much new technology. Ruby on Rails, for example, introduced innovations in Web development. It wasn&#8217;t the first web framework. Not even the first Web framework in Ruby. There were already a lot of web application frameworks in Ruby when Rails was released. But under the circumstances, Ruby on Rails implemented new ideas that triggered productivity enhancements in Ruby <span class="caps">AND</span> other languages (python, etc.). So Ruby on Rails had a huge impact on the web application development arena.</p>
<p>Whenever a new technology is created, the surrounding areas also enjoy the benefits of this technology. Not all new technologies will be successful, but some of them will really boost the entire IT industry.</p>
<p>We do see some of that trend in the industry. To support the new technology we need to have smart engineers (hackers). The smart engineers usually come to the interesting technology. Whenever there&#8217;s new technology that&#8217;s created, it invites the smart engineers who then create new technology. This is a positive cycle. Ruby is one of these positive cycle enforcers.</p>
<p>Benefit, Potential, and&#8230;.</p>
<p>Passion</p>
<p>The author of The Passionate Programmer, Chad Fowler, is here. I feel embarrassed to say something about him before his keynote. But I have to say this. He is right to emphasize passion. Many people are passionate about ruby. Engineer passion is very important.  Passion is key.</p>
<p>In the US there is a conference called RubyConf:http://rubyconf.org. The first one was held in Tampa Florida. There were only 34 attendees at the first conference. Right now we have more than 500 people attending. If the venue could handle it we could probably fit 700 or 1000. They actually limit the number of attendees. They sell out every year. This year RubyConf will be held in <a href="http://www.city.matsue.shimane.jp/kankou/en/">Matsue&#8217;s</a> sister city, New Orleans. It will be the 10th. It is the longest running Ruby conference on the globe.</p>
<p>Euruko. Poland, Barcelona, Berlin, Prague.  On the last day, Euruko always invites speakers to bid on where Euruko should be. Speakers make their case and the location of the next Euruko is voted on.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we had RubyKaigi.  It was held in Tsukuba City. Not in Tokyo. I graduated from Tsukuba univeristy. It made me feel like i was going home. We had about 700 people at RubyKaigi this year. RubyConf will have 500 (ed: actually 600 to 650). The biggest conference is held in Japan.</p>
<p>As you can see here in this venue as well Ruby World has so many people from so many countries. I would say that the IT industry is japan is becoming truly internationalized. We have a disadvantage in Matsue because it&#8217;s so remote, but the passion of the Rubyists makes it possible.</p>
<p>We also have regional Ruby conferences in India, China, Brazil, all over the US, etc. They also have another conference called RailsConf:http://railsconf.org, which is operated by a professional event management company (ed: and <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a>). They had 1800 people. So that really boosts Ruby.</p>
<p>Startup passion.  I&#8217;m going to talk about US companies, but there are many venture companies in Silicon valley who are very interested in Ruby. More than 60% of VCs use Ruby to provide the system.  Among the famous ones known to Japan includes Twitter. As a startup, they implemented everything using Ruby from bottom to top. Currently they have 100s of millions of users. Much of the RUby has been replaced but if you access twitter you can still see twitter driving the system.</p>
<p>As of last year another acronym was introduced &#8220;<span class="caps">ARC</span>&#8221;. Agile, Ruby/Rails, Cloud.  I&#8217;ve heard that VCs ask startups who aren&#8217;t using Ruby, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; Investors are pressuring startups to use Ruby. &#8220;It&#8217;s faster, so if you can shorten your release by one month why not use Ruby?&#8221;, they say.</p>
<p>A few years ago when startups were getting started, they wanted to attract smart engineers, so they used Ruby to attract them.</p>
<p>Executives&#8217; passion: Productivity is the key.  It&#8217;s not just the engineers who are passionate about Ruby. Productivity is one of the biggest factors for businesses. Executives started to realize the importance of using a productive language. Productive languages drive profit.  Some executives are finding hope in Ruby.</p>
<p>Differentiation can be found by using Ruby. The japanese IT industry is characterized by conservatism, so many may be reluctant to use Ruby. But by making the decision to use Ruby, they may differentiate themselves. There is also the possibility to change the entire industrial structure by switching to Ruby and other open source technologies, driving more SMBs.</p>
<p>In Japan, major IT companies receive contracts and subcontract to others. But with Ruby and smart engineers, these can be driven to small businesses which can innovate. This drives hope.</p>
<p>Motivation drives Hope</p>
<p>for Food<br />
for Money<br />
  These are very pragmatic</p>
<p>for Good Cause<br />
  But some people might make a bigger attempt to change the world.</p>
<p>Many people are finding hope in Ruby. Many found potential in Ruby.</p>
<p>Not all have succeeded.  Some are extremely successful. Some are not.  What made the difference?</p>
<p>In some cases, the benefit was not enough. Or people couldn&#8217;t see the potential. But the biggest factor was <span class="caps">PASSION</span>!  How passionate or decisive they were made the difference.</p>
<p>Lots of people love Ruby. Pictured here (ed: he shows a picture in his slide) are the smiling faces of the staff of the RubyKaigi. This is not organized by professionals. 700 turnout is already beyond its technical limits. But when we ran the survey, most people were satisfied by the conference. It&#8217;s miraculous considering the tough circumstances. But these people are passionate.</p>
<p>Many people are surrounding ruby. Hacker,s engineers, executives.  They <span class="caps">LOVE</span> Ruby.</p>
<p>Of course I love Ruby myself. It&#8217;s my child. Every day I am expanding my affection for Ruby. There are so many people out there that love Ruby. As a Japanese, I&#8217;m reluctant to say &#8220;love&#8221;. Actually one guy said &#8220;I love you&#8221;. I am poor at English. I was very embarrassed :) For Japanese, it&#8217;s difficult to express love in a direct fashion. Of course that guy didn&#8217;t mean &#8220;love&#8221;. He just loved Ruby. Like a strong kinship.</p>
<p>Many people love Ruby. Let me give you some examples:</p>
<p>NaCl. When i started at NaCl, Inoue-san he actually picked me up and allowed me to work on this. Back in 1995, there was no way to know if Ruby would be used by anyone. But the president, Mr. Inoue-san had the faith and the vision to hire me and let me work on Ruby. He gave me plenty of time to work on Ruby. It&#8217;s all possible because of him.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Matsue mayor actually visited our lab. We would like to use Ruby to revive the city. I had to reply, &#8220;Are you out of your mind?&#8221; Can you believe this person would try to revive our city using Ruby? Many people living in many places outside of Matsue, so I said maybe it&#8217;s difficult but someone from the city told me the Mayor was very serious about this. The mayor himself actually expressed his desire to use Ruby. So as a local government, Matsue city is committed to promote Ruby, which is very very exceptional on examination.  How much contribution we&#8217;re making to the city really is unknown.</p>
<p>This is Mr. Mizoguchi the Shimane governor. I don&#8217;t know how to show my appreciation to him. I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to thank him again. There are many other local governments who are interested in using Ruby to revive their city. But the question is how passionate are the top management or the governor or mayor? Even if the promoters work hard, unless top management is passionate about the promotion it&#8217;s not going to work.</p>
<p>One exceptional case is the governor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka">Fukuoka</a>.  A rival of Shimane :). For some reason he really loves Ruby. I&#8217;m living her and he&#8217;s in Fukuoka. There&#8217;s no relation. But Fukuoka is committed to using Ruby and they have organized the Fukuoka award and they have the <a href="http://rubybizcommons.jp/en/">Ruby Business Commons</a> headquarters.</p>
<p>Here is a noodle called Ruby on Matsue Ramen. The maker of this Ramen sent me an email. The maker of this has no connection to Ruby, but he has a local businesses and wants to promote Ruby. He offered to include the Ruby logo on this noodle to contribute to sales. It&#8217;s remarkable. This person volunteered to make Ruby Ramen for us without us asking.</p>
<p>And thanks to all the efforts of all these people, Ruby is exciting right now.</p>
<p>I have been engaged in Ruby for 17 years and i think it&#8217;s making sense for me to be passionate about Ruby. But many others are passionate about Ruby. I don&#8217;t understand why, but Ruby is loved. Love is driving Ruby.</p>
<p>With the support of so many people, we are able to hold this Ruby World conference for the next two days. And I hope that for these days we can fully discuss the benefits of Ruby so that it will be helpful to what you do. 17 years ago I was the only one person who used Ruby. But over 17 years, people who are using Ruby  (more than 1,000,000 people) in university Research, implemented in IT industry, etc.</p>
<p>Some of the things Ruby users are discussing are quite inspiring. Without this conference we can&#8217;t attract all of these great people to Matsue people. We should take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>Ruby is supported by passion. And by love.</p>
<p>One more thing: The Ruby Association which I chair provides Ruby programmer certification. We have this announcement today that we have created a new &#8220;Gold&#8221; certification for Ruby programmers. This requires a higher level of skill. If you go to the <a href="http://www.ruby-assn.org/en/">Ruby Association home page</a>, there is a press announcement which explains what you need to do to be qualified as Ruby &#8220;Gold&#8221; certified.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Instead of upgrading to the iPhone 4, I decided to get a Nexus One from Google. I&#8217;ve had it about a week so far and I&#8217;m happy with it.. Some friends and colleagues have asked for my impressions, so here is a brain-dump of the highlights so far:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Speech recognition is actually useful. Big surprise here. I can tweet, search the web etc. with minor edits to my dictated text</li>
	<li>I can write applications and put them on my own phone easily at no cost</li>
	<li>The <span class="caps">API</span> is (for my brain) much more straightforward than working with Cocoa. Maybe it&#8217;s the years of experience but I also strongly prefer working with Java over Objective-C</li>
	<li>I don&#8217;t miss the iTunes store. I was worried about that, but Amazon&#8217;s mp3 purchasing service is just as convenient (and you get mp3s instead of DRM&#8217;d media by default)</li>
	<li>The UI is clunkier and uglier than even the first iPhone</li>
	<li>I&#8217;m not finding myself missing any significant apps. There are some minor ones I wish I had but I don&#8217;t but it&#8217;s no big deal</li>
	<li>Wifi tethering (Android 2.2) is a good thing</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ve never met an on-screen keyboard I didn&#8217;t hate. Android is no exception.</li>
	<li>Kelly has an iPhone 4. We are traveling together. Everyone, everywhere asks her &#8220;Is that the new iPhone?&#8221;. Nobody anywhere asks me about my phone. (Actually one person did yesterday but I think she felt sorry for me not having a phone as fancy as Kelly&#8217;s)</li>
	<li>I thought the idea of widgets on the home screens would be faddy and lame (like it is in most cases on desktop OSes). It&#8217;s actually pretty useful.</li>
	<li>The Android message bus architecture makes some really neat system-level things possible from 3rd party apps. For example, I have a little app called Handcent <span class="caps">SMS</span> which improves on the built-in <span class="caps">SMS</span> functionality of the phone. As far as I know this sort of thing isn&#8217;t possible on the iPhone and i appreciate it as a user and as a developer.</li>
	<li>I had a Google IO phone a year ago and the Android ecosystem was barren in contrast to what I&#8217;m seeing today. That&#8217;s a huge change in only one year</li>
	<li>I can now differentiate my ring tone from that of everyone else around me in a public place :)</li>
	<li>I don&#8217;t know of a good way to download video to the phone. I like to watch television shows and movies on my phone while traveling on airplanes. iTunes makes that trivial for the iPhone. Fortunately I have an iPad, but it&#8217;s always nice to have a backup.</li>
	<li>The Kindle app is a wonderful thing. Just like it is everywhere else. Now to sell my actual Kindle. Anyone want to buy a first generation Kindle?</li>
	<li>I see Java exceptions more often than I would expect (java.net.UnknownHostException, for example). It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing when it happens, but being  a Java developer myself I&#8217;ve actually found it to be much more useful than the app just crashing. Sometimes the exception class thrown gives me a clue to help diagnose the problem. That makes me feel smart. I don&#8217;t think my parents would appreciate this feature.</li>
	<li>The background/multitasking stuff is nice.</li>
	<li>It reminds me of switching to desktop Linux.  Linux is usually uglier and less usable than its commercial rivals. Android is similarly ugly and slightly less usable. I also find Linux more exciting. You can get deep into its guts. You can customize it to your heart&#8217;s content. You can program it to the limit of your capabilities (as opposed to the limit of its <span class="caps">EULA</span>). And it&#8217;s weird, in both a good and a bad way. Unlike switching to desktop Linux, I&#8217;m often finding myself saying: &#8220;Oh, nice. I wish the iPhone had that.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>All that being said, I love my iPad and if I didn&#8217;t have it I might not have been able to so easily let go of the last remaining Apple mobile device I had available to me. If anyone wants to send me an Android tablet I&#8217;d gladly evaluate and review it.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to travel less this year. Since my job involves a lot of travel, this mostly translates into going to less conferences.</p>
<p>So for 2010 I so far have only one conference on the agenda (other than those I&#8217;m co-organizing): <a href="http://rubyconfindia.org/">RubyConf India</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m speaking at the event and also helping out on the proposal committee along with <a href="http://m.onkey.org/">Pratik Naik</a> and <a href="http://olabini.com/blog/">Ola Bini</a>.  So far the program is shaping up well, and I&#8217;m excited about the conference.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a combined technical and cultural education experience, I highly recommend going to RubyConf India.  Kelly and I <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2009/8/2/how-learning-a-second-language-changed-my-life">lived in Bangalore</a> several years ago and absolutely loved it there. We can&#8217;t wait to get back to our second home. Bangalore was a culture shock at first, but that&#8217;s another strong reason to go. For us, it went from culture shock to comfort. Bangalore certainly didn&#8217;t change to make that happen &#8212; we did.</p>
<p><img src="http://rubyconfindia.org/stock/rubyconf-badges/RubyConf2010/270X185_speaking.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, while it&#8217;s hectic, noisy,  and sometimes shocking, Bangalore is a beautiful place which had a profound effect on me. When I was there, I couldn&#8217;t find any other Ruby programmers. It will be really exciting to go back to an entire conference devoted to Rubyists.</p>
<p>Registration will be opening in the next couple of weeks. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/rubyconfindia">RubyConfIndia</a> on twitter for announcements. Bangalore men milenge?</p></div>

<p>My friend and fellow Rails developer John Lannon, lead developer at http://resonantvibes.com, was mugged last night while picking up dinner for his wife. He didn&#8217;t have anything on him to give to the robbers and they shot him point blank in the chest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we <a href="http://railsconf.com">opened the RailsConf Call For Proposals</a>. So we soon begin the several-month process of putting together the program for RailsConf 2010 (in Baltimore!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly excited to start the process this year, because we&#8217;ve made a very positive change to the team.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://davidchelimsky.net/">David Chelimsky</a> and I were chatting a couple of weeks ago about my recently acquired running hobby and he asked &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you organize a 5k race at RubyConf?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I said something like &#8220;heh&#8221;. Then we both thought about it some more and thought it might actually be a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>In a previous email, <a href="http://jlaine.net/">Jarkko Laine</a> had volunteered to coordinate some morning exercise sessions at RubyConf, so we&#8217;ve pulled him in as well.</p>
<p>So now, David, Jarkko, <a href="http://twitter.com/kellyjeanne">Kelly</a> and I are organizing some kind of 5k race for one of the mornings of RubyConf.</p>
<h2>Can you run 3.1 miles?</h2>
<p>If so, be on the lookout to sign up and have some fun.</p>
<p><b>If not, even better!</b> Chances are even if you don&#8217;t run at all right now, you can practice and get ready to run (or mostly run) 3.1 miles by RubyConf. Check out a program like <a href="http://www.c25k.com/">Couch to 5K</a> for an easy progressive schedule that will get you to running the distance without feeling like you&#8217;re killing yourself.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still getting our collective act together, but I wanted to share this to get you thinking about trying to run 5k if you haven&#8217;t before. There might be some fast people in the crowd but I&#8217;m hoping for a greater ratio of people who have never been able to run just trying to finish it.</p>
<p>So start training and see you there!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since finishing <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> I&#8217;ve been putting a lot of thought into how to package the advice from the book into something more structured, serial, and prescriptive.</p>
<p>The Amazon reviews for the book are almost all glowingly positive with the occasional piece of constructive criticism. Here&#8217;s one such excerpt from an otherwise positive review by Ira Laefksy which I agreed with and took to heart:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D32FLM2NZ3ES/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of a road map to carrying out this excellent advice over the career of a self-driven software professional and the only tool to locate the appropriate essay for choosing to carry out being the table of contents. Perhaps the author/editor will provide chronological/situation-based guidance to employing this life-changing advice in a companion web-site making the volume more accessible to the demands of a particular life/career situation in addition to being an invaluable set of essays.</a></p>
<p>Ira and I have the same idea. What I think we&#8217;re both looking for is a career development methodology.</p>
<p>As an example methodology pulled from the software field, Extreme Programming has always been codified as a set of distinct practices, all of which can be beneficially understood and adopted on their own. But, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/map/project.html">as the famous flowchart shows</a>, XP doesn&#8217;t just give you a bunch of great ideas about how to develop software. It tells you what to do when you get to work each morning.</p>
<p>The idea of following a software development methodology is nothing new to any of us in the field. It&#8217;s common practice. Software projects are expensive, complex and (sometimes) important. Letting them chaotically emerge isn&#8217;t a reasonable approach for a professional to take.</p>
<p>So why should our careers be any different?</p>
<p><a href="http://swaine.com">Mike Swaine</a> recently approached me about writing an article for<br />
 the Pragmatic Bookshelf&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/magazines">PragPub issue #3</a>. I decided to use this as an opportunity to explore some of the ideas I&#8217;ve had about crystalizing the advice from The Passionate Programmer into a prescriptive career development methodology.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m onto something, but I&#8217;d like feedback.  The article, titled &#8220;Clone Yourself &#8211; Destroy Your Job Through Automation and Outsourcing&#8221;,  contains just the beginnings of what I have in mind. Please <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/magazines">go read it</a> and let me know what you think.</p></div>
