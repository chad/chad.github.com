  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/">Alan Francis</a> is a long time<br />
industry veteran and agile development guru. I met him several years ago<br />
when he was my team&#8217;s coach at Object mentor&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.objectmentor.com/courses/xpImmersion">XP Immersion</a><br />
(taught by Robert Martin, Ron Jeffries, and Kent Beck).</p>
<p>
<p>More recently, he was one of the early draft reviewers of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">my book</a>. He had<br />
the following <a
href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/2005/09/my_job_went_to_.html">to say<br />
about it</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        The book is, in my head at least, a companion volume to Pragmatic
        Programmer. PragProg gave a list of concrete advice for programmers
        to improve their programming. MJWTI (as the new book is affectionately
        known) gives a list of good concrete advice for programmer to improve
        everything else that makes them employable.
</pre>
<p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first comparison between <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic<br />
Programmer</a> that I&#8217;ve heard, and I hope it won&#8217;t be the<br />
last. Since reading it in 2000, The Pragmatic Programmer has been on my<br />
short list of books I recommend to every programmer I work with, because<br />
being a programmer and <em>not</em> having read it is a crime. It just has<br />
too much to offer the average programmer <a
href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/2296">to go unread</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If <span class="caps">MJWTI</span> can help as many people in as profound a way, the investment will<br />
have been well worth it to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are now sample chapters <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">available</a>, and<br />
the book can be pre-ordered (the <span class="caps">PDF</span> ships <em>now</em>, and the paper copy<br />
ships at the end of this month). I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts as<br />
you read it (even just the sample chapters). <a

started <a
href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/articles/2005/08/24/new-podcasts">podcasting</a>.<br />
Much to my delight, he chose to record an excerpt from the introduction to<br />
<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> (<span class="caps">MJWTI</span>). It&#8217;s the very beginning of the book which tells<br />
the story of my first experiences in India (My job <em>did</em> go to<br />
India. I went with it).</p>
<p>
<p>Listening to my own words read by someone else (and really well, I might<br />
add) is <em>bizarre</em>. I think the book might actually be better this<br />
way. I could also smell the idlis and sambar (maybe I&#8217;m just hungry).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.toolshed.com/downloads/podcasts/MJWTIIntro.mp3">Give it<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to Randstad, only <a
href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/24/pf/workplace_morale/index.htm?section=money_pf">40<br />
percent of employees feel that morale is good at their workplace</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>Think about the last time you were in a bad morale situation at work (for<br />
60% percent of you, that&#8217;s right now). How good was your performance?<br />
How good a job do you do when you&#8217;re not happy with what you&#8217;re<br />
doing or who you&#8217;re doing it for?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ll answer for you. You do a mediocre job at best. Most likely, you<br />
do a poor job.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If I want someone to do a mediocre job, I&#8217;m going to look for the<br />
cheapest available option. In programming terms, that means low hourly<br />
rate. In today&#8217;s environment, low hourly rate means India, China, the<br />
Phillipines or some other &quot;low cost country&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Is our morale low because we&#8217;re being squeezed for more work at lower<br />
wages and because we&#8217;re constantly facing the threat of being<br />
offshored? Or are we constantly facing the threat of being offshored<br />
<em>because</em> our morale is low, and we are doing, collectively, a<br />
mediocre job?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Registration for the <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">Fifth International<br />
Ruby Conference</a> is up to greater than <a

number</a> of the largest conference to-date. And that&#8217;s not counting<br />
the usual last-minute surge in registration before the conference.</p>
<p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/agenda.html">the<br />

href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/register/">register</a>, and<br />
(if you or your company have the means) consider <a

(thank you!) with a couple more companies lined up.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is a great chance to meet Matz and many of the leaders of the Ruby<br />
community and the software development industry in general.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not speaking, bring your ideas. Some big ideas (and<br />
code) have come out of conferences past. You&#8217;d be surprised what can<br />
be accomplished in between the sessions of a 3-day conference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a followup to my <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/LoveItOrLeaveIt.rdoc,v">previous<br />
post</a>, Tim Case has <a
href="http://karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/24/love-it-or-leave-it-indeed">posted<br />
an inspirational story</a> about having the courage to take control of his<br />
own career as a software developer.</p>
<p>
<p>Frustrated by the software industry and the job market, Tim (like many<br />
software developers, I&#8217;d bet) struggled with whether to find a new<br />
line of work altogether. Here&#8217;s a cliffhanger for you:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  I didn't want to leave because I was learning
  more about software and each new thing I learned made me want to keep
  learning more but I also couldn't keep throwing myself into the winds
  of marketplace expectations.  I gave up on trying to get lucky and find
  that dream job.

  So what did I do?
</pre>
<p>
<p>He took matters into his own hands. Give it a read.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I also stumbled across Kathy Sierra&#8217;s <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/you_20.html">You<br />
2.0</a> post on the always thought-provoking <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users">Creating<br />
Passionate Users</a> weblog.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The common theme is that it&#8217;s never too late to take control of your<br />
destiny. Most people just never realize it&#8217;s even <em>possible</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Do you have a similar story? I&#8217;d love to <a
href="mailto:chad+loveitorleaveit@chadfowler.com">hear about it</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in a <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Writing/MyJobWentToIndiaDone.rdoc,v">previous<br />
post</a>, though my goal was to help others, the process of writing <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> has already helped <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>
<p>While living in Bangalore, I saw <a
href="http://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> speak at a<br />
Thoughtworks-sponsored event on agile development. The one thing he said<br />
that has stuck with me since then is that when he wants to learn about<br />
something, he writes about it. It&#8217;s obvious that writing a book or an<br />
essay on a topic would help you learn about it, but it never occurred to me<br />
that these guru-authors might be writing about things that they<br />
didn&#8217;t already know before starting a book or article. Writing is<br />
both a process of documentation <tt>and</tt> discovery.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense when you&#8217;re writing about a technology.<br />
There are bound to be nooks and crannies that you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
explored, even if you&#8217;re an expert. To present a complete picture,<br />
you&#8217;re going to have to dig into things you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
had a need for.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What wasn&#8217;t as obvious to me was that the same would be true of<br />
non-tech writing. My book isn&#8217;t a reference manual. It&#8217;s a<br />
collection of bits of advice. It&#8217;s less about knowledge and more<br />
about common sense, good judgement, and wisdom. So the nooks and crannies I<br />
explored as I wrote weren&#8217;t in obscure language features or rarely<br />
touched APIs. They were in concepts that I had either taught myself or had<br />
absorbed through osmosis from the wiser people around me throughout my<br />
career.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>While I was codifying ideas that had been everyday companions to me for<br />
years, they went from being rough and ragged to polished. Not only were<br />
they clearer for my readers (the purpose of the polishing) but they were<br />
actually <em>better</em>. As a result I have produced advice that, at least<br />
on a granular level, is new to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this one particular section of my book that I learned a<br />
<em>lot</em> from. I&#8217;ve read it many times since it was written, and<br />
I&#8217;ve thought about it even more. It&#8217;s called &quot;Love it or<br />
Leave it&quot;. The premise is that, if you don&#8217;t love what<br />
you&#8217;re doing, you won&#8217;t be <em>great</em> at it. Or to flip it<br />
around, if you love your job, you stand a much greater chance of being<br />
great at it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Stated alone like this, it couldn&#8217;t get any more obvious. But this<br />
book is about making things actionable. I realized as I thought about it<br />
that I was unable to come up with a recent personal example of how<br />
<em>I</em> had taken this most primitive piece of advice and done something<br />
about it. My career had taken a turn that most Americans would consider to<br />
be &quot;success&quot;, and I had let it take me where it wanted. That<br />
meant management in big corporations.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But the undercurrent that was always tugging on me was that I looked at a<br />
lot of my friends in the industry with a feeling of envy. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could (at least attempt to) innovate all day. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could write Ruby code full time. I wished <em>I</em> could work<br />
in an environment that was 100% focused on getting things done instead of<br />
drifting in the tides of corporate politics. I wanted to work for a company<br />
that was focused on <em>winning</em> instead of trying not to<br />
<em>lose</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So I decided to take my own advice and find this environment I&#8217;d been<br />
looking for. On the same day that I decided to look, I <a
href="http://naviance.com">found it</a>. <a
href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> and I are moving to Denver, so<br />
that I can be a full time Ruby (on <a
href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>) developer for Naviance.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Several years in the big corporate world creates a lot of inertia.<br />
It&#8217;s no easy decision to make. But it feels <em>right</em> once<br />
it&#8217;s done, and the interactions I&#8217;ve had with my new team only<br />
serve to reinforce my choice.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The team is going to stay small and focused. We&#8217;re looking for a <a
href="http://www.naviance.com/company/webdes.html">designer with Rails<br />
experience</a>. Might this be the leap you&#8217;ve been waiting to make?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, I finished making copy edits, and <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave</a> finished the<br />
(beautiful!) layout. <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> is ready to go to the printers!</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/mjwti_medium.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I started this book, I considered the amount of effort (which I<br />
underestimated, of course) it would take to finish it. I decided that,<br />
given how much of a strain it would be over and above the &quot;day<br />
job&quot;, it wasn&#8217;t likely I would make enough money for it to be<br />
worthwhile. (It was never about that anyway, of course). So, the only way<br />
to make the book worth writing was to create something that could really<br />
<tt>help</tt> people.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Reading through it now, I can confidently say that I have accomplished that<br />
goal. Sure, it seems premature to say, considering the fact that only a<br />
handful of people have read the book. But, what I&#8217;ve found is that it<br />
has already helped <tt>me</tt>. More on that later&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now&#8217;s when the fun starts.</p>

<p>As of this week, not counting downloads of the <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/">Ruby Windows<br />
Installer</a>, the RubyGems framework has been downloaded more than 50,000<br />
times. Within a week, it will have served up <a
href="http://gems.rubyforge.org/stats.html">half a million gems</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, who&#8217;s going to create the 300th gem?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Be sure to watch the <a href="http://onestepback.org/gemwatch.rss">rss<br />
feed</a> if you want to find out which gem pulled across the 300 mark.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not to be outdone by the Seattle.rb crew, Greg and James are <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ruby_gambit/">broadcasting their<br />
progress</a> on their <a

grant</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch an ongoing, quickly moving project like this. As<br />
Tom Copeland mentioned on <a href="http://ruby-talk.org">ruby-talk</a>, you<br />
can see the <span class="caps">CVS</span> age sticking around in minutes (and not hours or days).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When it&#8217;s finished, Gambit looks like it&#8217;s going to be<br />
something fun to play with:</p>
</p>

        Gambit is pure Ruby framework for building multiplayer Web games
        offering two key services:  Game management and design tools.  Gambit
        can manage player's accounts, game hosting and joining, player
        histories, in-game communication systems and out-of-game notifications
        for in-game activities.

<p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see these RubyCentral CodeFests starting to happen.</p>
