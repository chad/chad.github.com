  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a delightfully thought provoking trip to the Joan Miro museum<br />
yesterday, I was sadly disappointed with our trip to the Museu Picasso<br />
today. If you&#8217;re going to Barcelona and plan to see both of these<br />
sites, I suggest you visit the Museu Picasso first. The bar was just raised<br />
too high by the Joan Miro museum.</p>
<p>
<p>The permanent exhibit was closed, but there was no sign that warned us of<br />
this before buying tickets. The security guards were ruthless and militant.<br />
The exhibition halls were narrow and crowded with obnoxious Americans who<br />
walked slowly from painting to painting and clumped in front of them to<br />
talk about unrelated pulp. And, finally, the entire area surrounding the<br />
museum smells like a sewer.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I left the museum feeling like:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t really like Picasso</li>
<li>He seemed to get worse and less interesting as he got older</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t really care to find out if I&#8217;m misguided about my<br />
opinion so far</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Kelly assures me that it&#8217;s more the museum&#8217;s fault than<br />
Picasso&#8217;s and that they neither adequately represented his evolution<br />
as an artist nor did they actually show many of his really good work. I<br />
believe her, and I&#8217;m sure the above will be a memory by tomorrow<br />
morning.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Something I forgot from yesterday is that I&#8217;ve found a new (for me)<br />
artist to follow up on. A French Surrealist named Yves Tanguy. I&#8217;ve<br />
always been a Salvador Dali fan&#8212;especially back when I was into Iron<br />
Maiden album cover art, and Tanguy&#8217;s paintings appeal to me in the<br />
same way Dali&#8217;s do.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to resist such a charming face:</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<p>This picture was taken in 1936. I wonder if this was a typical hair style<br />
for Paris in the 30s. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, we visited the Fundacio Miro (<a
href="http://www.bcn.fjmiro.es">www.bcn.fjmiro.es</a>), which is<br />
deceptively close to our hotel. I say deceptively, because, while it was<br />
the shortest walk we&#8217;ve taken so far on this trip, it&#8217;s<br />
straight up hill from here. We made the mistake of this being the first<br />
morning that we&#8217;ve skipped breakfast, which made it extra<br />
frustrating. I can feel myself getting older. I can&#8217;t remember a time<br />
five years ago when I lamented not having eaten breakfast.</p>
<p>
<p>I really enjoy museums that are dedicated to a single artist. We saw works<br />
spanning from when Miro was eight years old to around the time he died.<br />
I&#8217;m far from what you would call an art enthusiast, and I&#8217;m<br />
horribly ignorant by most counts, but a format like this allows me to walk<br />
through and observe&#8212;in a very obvious way&#8212;how the artist<br />
changed over time.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is the second such museum I&#8217;ve visited&#8212;the first being the<br />
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (<a
href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl">www.vangoghmuseum.nl</a>). We made a<br />
failed attempt to see the Edvard Munch Museum (<a
href="http://www.museumsnett.no/munchmuseet">www.museumsnett.no/munchmuseet</a>)<br />
in Oslo, but after a long (and also fully uphill) walk, it was closed.<br />
Disappointing, but not nearly as much as our post-5-mile-walk view of the<br />
Brandenburg Gate (<a
href="http://www.dailysoft.com/east-berlin/mitte/bgate.htm">www.dailysoft.com/east-berlin/mitte/bgate.htm</a>),<br />
covered for construction and featuring a cartoonish, life sized<br />
<b>picture</b> of the monument.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Something I noticed as a potential pattern today is that many of the great<br />
20th century artists started off in realism and ended in the Avant Garde.<br />
This doesn&#8217;t apply to just painting, but also to music and writing<br />
(at least). A notable musical example is Albert Ayler (<a
href="http://www.ayler.supanet.com">www.ayler.supanet.com</a>), bebop-esque<br />
saxophonist who ended his career playing purely emotional, energized music<br />
rendered in a loose framework more reminiscent of the world&#8217;s<br />
national anthems than jazz standards, or Arnold Schoenberg, the founder of<br />
atonal music in the Western classical tradition. As I walked through the<br />
Miro museum, I thought a lot about why this happens. And&#8212;a longer<br />
topic I won&#8217;t get into&#8212;how this might apply to computer<br />
programming, if you buy into the idea that programming is an art form. More<br />
on this later&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Something that specifically caught my attention about Miro is that, as a<br />
lover of poetry, he wanted to find a way to express poetry through visual<br />
art. He was quoted (though I&#8217;m not sure of the exact quote nor the<br />
source since I read it in the museum) as saying that he both blurred the<br />
distinction between art and poetry and appreciated poetry in terms of its<br />
potential visual representations. I would normally dismiss this kind of<br />
talk as the pretentious ramblings of a self-obssessed &quot;Artiste&quot;,<br />
but Miro actually took some apparent steps to realize his desire to merge<br />
poetry and art. Over time (crystalizing in the early<br />
1930&#8217;s&#8212;which seems to be my favorite period of his work) he<br />
developed an iconographic vocabulary or &quot;visual language&quot; which<br />
formed the basis of most of his work for the rest of his life. With this<br />
&quot;language&quot;, he developed visual &quot;poems&quot; that presumably<br />
had some meaning beyond the abstract shapes, colors, and textures that we<br />
laypeople see when we look at them. I searched the museum book shop for a<br />
&quot;Miro Visual Phrasebook&quot; but didn&#8217;t find one (though we<br />
<b>did</b> find some placemats with pictures and their associated meanings<br />
in French). It&#8217;s possible (though beside the point, really) that<br />
I&#8217;m making more of this than Miro did, but the idea of a visual (or<br />
audial, for that matter) meta-language for embedding meaning in art has a<br />
definite appeal to the musician/computer-geek/wannabe-linguist in me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As a composer (of music), I was always annoyed by conversations that<br />
started with: &quot;What are you trying to <b>say</b> with this<br />
piece?&quot; <b>Nothing</b>. I&#8217;m not trying to say <b>anything</b>.<br />
It&#8217;s <b>music</b>, I thought. In fact, I was particularily impressed<br />
today by the fact that many of Miro&#8217;s paintings are titled<br />
&quot;Painting&quot;. In the same vein, my last piece of music was called<br />
&quot;Quartet&quot;. But, with Miro&#8217;s meta-language, maybe his<br />
paintings really <b>are</b> &quot;saying something&quot; in the literal<br />
sense. Why not? The challenge of marrying the encoded meaning and the<br />
aesthetic and more fuzzy aspects of the piece would be especially<br />
interesting. Maybe this is what David Morgan-Mar had in mind when he<br />
created the Piet Programming Language (<a
href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html">www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html</a>),<br />
in which programs are &quot;written&quot; as digital abstract art.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As an aside, there was one painting in the entire exhibit that drew my<br />
attention more than any other. I saw it from across the room and had to<br />
wait behind a crowd of people who were chatting before getting a close<br />
look. I was a bit surprised when Kelly read the title to me:</p>
</p>
<h1>Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement</h1>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/excrement.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t ya know I would pick a picture of excrement to be interested<br />
in.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Perhaps tomorrow we&#8217;ll tour the Picasso museum.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following a thread from the previous post (/<a
href="index.cgi/Travel/Europe/Miro.rdoc,v">Travel/Europe/Miro</a>), I just<br />
stumbled across Basic English (<a
href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/basiceng.html">ogden.basic-english.org/basiceng.html</a>).<br />
Basic English is an attempt to deobfuscate the English language, primarily<br />
by reducing its vocabulary from the tens of thousands present in standard<br />
English to 850.</p>
<p>
<p>Basic English is a subset of English, complete with its grammatical<br />
exceptions and ambiguities. I wonder how much munging it would take to make<br />
an easily computer-parsable English. How strange would English have to look<br />
(to a human) for a computer to be able to understand it as well? I would<br />
really like to be able to search for articles on the web that contain, for<br />
example, negative opinions about a specific topic. Or how about: &quot;All<br />
pages which contradict the statement the following assertion&#8230;&quot;<br />
(followed by some English text which states something as fact). I&#8217;ve<br />
been thinking a lot lately about how to make this sort of things possible<br />
with standard English, but if English were disambiguously computer<br />
parsable, it would be simple.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The fact that Lojban (<a href="http://www.lojban.org">www.lojban.org</a>)<br />
is computer parsable (<a
href="http://www.lojban.org/resources/tools.html">www.lojban.org/resources/tools.html</a>)<br />
has always excited me, but I&#8217;m afraid that if I wrote my web posts in<br />
Lojban, nobody would read them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spur of the moment, we decided to take a vacation. Two days later,<br />
we&#8217;ve got tickets and hotel reservations in Barcelona.</p>
<p>
<p>Busy with work, I haven&#8217;t taken the time to learn <b>anything</b><br />
about what Spain will be like. I know two things:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve never been there before.</li>
<li>A lot of people will probably speak Spanish (though, in Barcelona, the<br />
predominant language seems to be Catalan (<a
href="http://www.june29.com/HLP/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html">www.june29.com/<span class="caps">HLP</span>/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>(Are nested parentheses an intuitive construct for non-programming readers<br />
of English?)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I hope the Catalonians won&#8217;t be too offended if we try to speak<br />
Spanish to them. I don&#8217;t think we have time to learn Catalan.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, a week and a half from now, I&#8217;ll be back&#8212;hopefully<br />
refreshed and having risen my once-decent knowledge of basic Spanish from<br />
the dead. If there&#8217;s anything interesting to look at in Spain, I<br />
might even post a picture or two.</p>

<p>
<p>Hasta la vista.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, I read an article about Latent Semantic Indexing (<a
href="http://javelina.cet.middlebury.edu/lsa/out/lsa_intro.htm">javelina.cet.middlebury.edu/lsa/out/lsa_intro.htm</a>)<br />
which has been stewing in my mind ever since. I thought I&#8217;d sit down<br />
and make a link to it here, and as I started the search for the article I<br />
realized that I should have bookmarked it. So I thought, &quot;Maybe I<br />
<em>did</em> bookmark it, but just forgot.&quot; I looked in my bookmarks<br />
list, and there were five or six unrecognizable links there. So, I headed<br />
back to Google and restarted the longer-than-it-needed-to-be process of<br />
relocating the article.</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve never taught myself to use bookmarks<br />
effectively. If I remember correctly, they&#8217;ve been around since the<br />
first version of Mosaic that I used several years ago. It&#8217;s probably<br />
largely a result of laziness, though I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the<br />
whole story. I think it&#8217;s mostly driven by the way I use the web.<br />
It&#8217;s very rare that I load up my browser with the specific intent of<br />
visiting one page on the internet. My typical information-addicted browsing<br />
scenario (I optimistically and euphemistcally refer to it as &quot;checking<br />
my email&quot;) starts with scanning the messages from the various mailing<br />
lists I&#8217;m subscribed to. Usually one or more messages will catch my<br />
eye. Some will contain URLs that I will follow. Some contain a subject I<br />
want to follow up on, which leads me to a search engine. Some just get me<br />
thinking about something that may or may not even be related.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>More often than not, the initial scan of my inbox leads to the spawning of<br />
multiple unrelated threads. For example, I might have several browser<br />
windows dedicated to a linguistics topic, a couple loading up BusinessWeek<br />
and Forbes, and a third set pointing to something related to Ruby<br />
programming. And, from here, the same behaviour that got me started comes<br />
into play. Each new page has the potential of forking off several new<br />
threads on potentially unrelated topics. It&#8217;s a potentially infinite<br />
recursive loop.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If I tried to bookmark all this stuff, I would spend as much time<br />
bookmarking and organizing as I do reading the content. Interestingly, the<br />
topic of this post, which has led me into this explanation of why I<br />
don&#8217;t use bookmarks is itself a potential solution to the problem.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Latent Semantic Indexing (<span class="caps">LSI</span>) is a technique used for indexing and<br />
relating information based on its semantic &quot;closeness&quot;. I&#8217;m<br />
certainly not an expert, having only read a few articles on it now, but<br />
here&#8217;s a probably-bad explanation of how it works: For each document<br />
in a set, it generates a vector showing the document&#8217;s inclusion or<br />
non-inclusion of the words in a master word list. It then uses a technique<br />
called Singular Value Decomposition (<a
href="http://kwon3d.com/theory/jkinem/svd.html">kwon3d.com/theory/jkinem/svd.html</a>)<br />
to compress the many relationships in this &quot;term/document grid&quot;<br />
into fewer relationships&#8212;basically converging some of the things that<br />
were different into sameness. At this point, you can calculate any<br />
vector&#8217;s closeness (as in <b>physical</b> closeness&#8212;using Math<br />
I never learned in school) to another, giving you an indication of how<br />
semantically close the two are.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For example, imagine you have a collection of documents, about computer<br />
programming topics. As a human, you could read an article about object<br />
oriented programming, another about <span class="caps">UML</span>, and another about Martin<br />
Fowler&#8217;s book &quot;<span class="caps">UML</span> Distilled&quot;. Even if the last article<br />
didn&#8217;t specifically contain the text &quot;Object Oriented<br />
Programming&quot;, you would be able to make the mental connection between<br />
Martin Fowler and object oriented programming, because you know that <span class="caps">UML</span> is<br />
related to <span class="caps">OOP</span> and that Martin Fowler is a <span class="caps">UML</span> guru. With a typical,<br />
keyword-based search engine, the last article I mentioned wouldn&#8217;t<br />
appear in a set of search results for &quot;object oriented<br />
programming&quot;, because it didn&#8217;t contain the text you were<br />
searching for. A search engine using Latent Semantic Indexing, would be<br />
able to determine that Martin Fowler is <strong>semantically close</strong> to object<br />
oriented programming and would still return the <span class="caps">UML</span> article as a match for<br />
the search.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So what does this have to do with bookmarks? I was lucky in that one of my<br />
multiple browsing threads on the day I came across <span class="caps">LSI</span> led me to Agent<br />
Frank (<a
href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank">www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank</a>).<br />
Agent Frank is a personal web proxy. You run it on your PC, and it tracks,<br />
archives, and indexes the sites you visit. It can also do things that<br />
I&#8217;m not as exicted about like blocking banner ads. The really<br />
exciting thing here is that it is a step toward <strong>smart bookmarks</strong>. If Agent<br />
Frank can track everything I look at, I don&#8217;t have to worry about<br />
remembering which sites I&#8217;ve seen. Now, imagine coupling this<br />
capability with <span class="caps">LSI</span>. A personal web proxy that archives the content you<br />
visit and <b>then</b> indexes it with <span class="caps">LSI</span>, could remind you of related<br />
pages you&#8217;ve seen as you browse. It could, of course, as Agent Frank<br />
already does, include a search engine so that you could find pages you had<br />
seen before&#8212;but without the hassle of having to remember keywords<br />
that appeared in the pages. It could also use the semantic closeness of the<br />
documents you view to build an index of what you are interested in. After a<br />
browsing session, it could present you with an intelligently constructed<br />
list of the categories of the information you have been browsing.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I really like the idea of reading a new page, thinking &quot;This page<br />
<b>reminds</b> me of something&#8230;&quot;, and clicking a browser button<br />
labeled &quot;Recall Similar&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with my own implementation of almost-<span class="caps">LSI</span>,<br />
inspired by a nice tutorial (<a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html">www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html</a>)<br />
by Maciej Ceglowski (<a
href="http://www.idlewords.com">www.idlewords.com</a>). My version is, as<br />
you might guess, in Ruby. And, it integrates with my weblog software (<a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rublog">www.sourceforge.net/projects/rublog</a>).<br />
As is the case with many of the Ruby projects I&#8217;ve worked on, I was<br />
surprised to discover that shortly after I started working on it, I had a<br />
functional piece of software that could calculate semantic sameness given a<br />
search query or an existing document. If I can find the time to clean it up<br />
over the next week, you might find a &quot;What&#8217;s Related&quot; link<br />
for each story on my website.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Hopefully, though I&#8217;m still learning this stuff, it will be a little<br />
less braindead than Google&#8217;s &quot;What&#8217;s Related&quot; (<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=related%3Awww.chadfowler.com&btnG=Google+Search">www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;oe=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;q=related%3Awww.chadfowler.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a>),<br />
which returns a mix of pages that I have linked to, have linked to me, or<br />
seem to have no logical relationship whatsoever. There are at least a<br />
couple that I&#8217;d really not like to think of as &quot;Similar&quot;,<br />
as Google labels them.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I also started today on my own Agent Frank replacement, with builtin <span class="caps">LSI</span>.<br />
I&#8217;ve got a stupid simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Proxy working and archiving everything<br />
I view. If all goes well and I don&#8217;t lose focus (<a
href="index.cgi/AttentionSpanChallenged.html,v">AttentionSpanChallenged</a>)<br />
I might have something basic working in the next week or so. Exciting<br />
stuff. I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t do this for a living&#8230;it might not<br />
be as fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Austin Ziegler has revived (<a

Ruby <span class="caps">RSS</span> module from the dead. He&#8217;s rewritten it to use <span class="caps">REXML</span> (<a

which I had actually finished 6 months ago but never uploaded and has also<br />
added support for <span class="caps">RSS</span> 0.92 and <span class="caps">RSS</span> 2.0. So, if you want to do some really<br />
nice, easy , validating <span class="caps">RSS</span> creation or parsing, head over and check<br />
Austin&#8217;s code out. If you have existing code that uses my old module,<br />
it should work with few or no changes. He hasn&#8217;t released the new<br />

he&#8217;d love to have some beta testers.</p>
<p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d get around to helping him finish up or maybe even<br />
adding <span class="caps">RSS</span> 1.0 support, but so far I haven&#8217;t been able to muster the<br />
gumption. I guess <span class="caps">RSS</span> has finally fallen into the category of things<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/">Martin Porter</a>, creator of the <br />
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/index.html">Porter <br />
Stemming Algorithm</a> wrote an interesting pair of essays <br />
(<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/essays/burkequote.html">1</a>, <br />
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/essays/burkequote2.html">2</a>), <br />
tracing the misuse of a famous quote by Edmund Burke through the web.  <br />
It&#8217;s a very interesting read to see how the quote (approximately &#8220;All that <br />
is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing&#8221;) has evolved <br />
over time into various forms which sometimes suffer semantic loss and even <br />
complete reversal of meaning.<br />
<p><br />
But, the <i>really</i> interesting part is the climax of the story.  As he tries <br />
to validate the original quote, he discovers that there <i>is no original</i>.  <br />
It&#8217;s been somehow conjured up, associated with Edmund Burke, and then used <br />
excessively on the internet and in other places.<br />
<p><br />
This got me thinking about how these things spread&#8212;specifically about <br />
how misinformation can be spread on the web like a virus.  This is, of course, <br />
following from the same ideas that led me to <a href="/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">recently <br />
say</a> that &#8220;blogging&#8221; with it&#8217;s unbridled, so-easy-my-grandmother-can-do-it <br />
web publishing functionality is a problem that the internet needs a solution <br />
for.  There&#8217;s no accountability for what&#8217;s published.  I have no professional <br />
or ethical requirement to not make mistakes or flat-out <i>lie</i> on my <br />
personal web site.<br />
<p><br />
Take the following example:  Anyone who knows me is aware that I&#8217;m a student <br />
of the Hindi language.  I&#8217;ve gotten to the point of being conversational if <br />
not near-fluent.  Let me teach you a sentence:<br />
<blockquote><br />
  Tu paagal kutta hai.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll walk you through it, word by word:<br>
<b>&#8220;Tu&#8221;</b> means &#8220;you&#8221;.  There are three forms of &#8220;you&#8221; in Hindi: &#8220;Tu&#8221;, &#8220;Tum&#8221;, <br />
and &#8220;Aap&#8221;.  These forms are used in addressing people in different relationships <br />
with the speaker, specifically to denote respect.  The most respectful form of <br />
&#8220;you&#8221; in Hindi is &#8220;Tu&#8221;, which is used both to address elders and God.  When in <br />
doubt, use &#8220;Tu&#8221;.  It is sometimes acceptable to use &#8220;Tum&#8221;, but it&#8217;s better to <br />
stay on the safe side and use &#8220;Tu&#8221; if you&#8217;re not sure of which to use.  You <br />
wouldn&#8217;t want to offend anyone.  Only use &#8220;Aap&#8221; when addressing animals or <br />
people of much lower castes.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;paagal&#8221;</b> is a possessive word that means &#8220;my&#8221; or &#8220;ours&#8221;.  In this case, <br />
&#8220;tu&#8221; is the subject of the sentence, and &#8220;paagal&#8221; implies that I am saying that <br />
&#8220;you are mine&#8221;.  If I wanted to say &#8220;yours&#8221;, I would change &#8220;paagal&#8221; to <br />
&#8220;paagalwala&#8221;.  &#8220;paagal&#8221; is both the root word or stem and the first person <br />
possessive form.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;kutta&#8221;</b> means &#8220;ray of light&#8221;.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;hai&#8221;</b> means &#8220;is&#8221; or &#8220;are&#8221;.  The root word here is &#8220;hona&#8221; and it is <br />
conjugated in various ways depending on the subject of the sentence.  &#8220;tu&#8221; <br />
goes with &#8220;hai&#8221;, &#8220;tum&#8221; goes with &#8220;ho&#8221;, and &#8220;aap&#8221; goes with &#8220;hain&#8221;.<br />
<br>
So, the complete translation of this sentence is a very respectful:<br />
<blockquote><br />
You are my ray of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very similar, of course, to the familiar <i>&#8220;you are my sunshine&#8221;</i>.  <br />
Interestingly, this phrase is very common in Indian society and is usually used <br />
to express gratitude in formal situations.<br />
<br>
You might be surprised when you got off the plane in India, expressed your <br />
gratitude to the nearest person with the only Hindi phrase you know and deeply <br />
offended them (perhaps even eliciting mild violence).  &#8220;Tu paagal kutta hai&#8221; is <br />
a very disrespectful way of delivering the very disrespectful content: &#8220;You are <br />
a crazy dog&#8221;.  If you were to do some casual web validation, you would find that <br />
there really are multiple ways to say &#8220;you&#8221;, each with varying levels of respect implied.<br />
You would also find that words are conjugated in a similar what to that which I <br />
described above.  You might, in this casual validation-search decide that my<br />
description is basically consistent with other sites you can find and that I can<br />
probably be trusted. <br />
<p><br />
How were <i>you</i> supposed to know?<br />
<p><br />
How many times do you read something on the web from what seems to be a <br />
reliable source and just take it for granted?  A colleague and I were working <br />
yesterday to try to plan an event.  We were worried that it would conflict with <br />
Thanksgiving, so we each hit Google to try to find out when Thanksgiving is.  <br />
&#8220;November 27, 2003&#8221; yielded the minutes of a meeting that had not yet happened.  <br />
We had a good chuckle, but it was still using this same method and from this <br />
same proven-to-be-corrupt data set that we eventually decided that November 27 <br />
was <i>not</i> Thanksgiving (or was it?).<br />
<p><br />
Maybe I&#8217;m an idiot, but I&#8217;ve fallen into a rhythm of just trusting what I <br />
see on the internet.  It&#8217;s a bad habit born out of laziness.  This probably <br />
wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing to do in 1994, but in the days of the &#8220;blogroll&#8221;, it <br />
falls apart.<br />
<p><br />
As I was thinking about this when I woke up today, I did some browsing around <br />
some of those <a href="/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">Category 2</a> <br />
(completely useless) websites I mentioned in my last related post.  I specifically <br />
looked at some of the sites which seem to form a tight-knit community, looking <br />
at semantic loss and/or distortion from site to site.  This is hardly what <br />
you could call a representative sample (1 data point), but interestingly the <br />
very first article that I looked at was an absolutely misguided reaction to an <br />
article on a &#8220;sister site&#8221;, which completely misinterpreted and then restated <br />
a major point made on the site to which it was referring.  The article&#8217;s <br />
meaning changed in at least two major ways with only one step away from its origin.<br />
<p><br />
Potter ends his essays with a set of <b>Principles for Quotations</b>:<br />
<pre><br />
Principle 1 (for readers)<br />
    Whenever you see a quotation given with an author but no source assume <br />
    that it is probably bogus.</p>
<p>Principle 2 (for readers)<br />
    Whenever you see a quotation given with a full source assume that <br />
    it is probably being misused, unless you find good evidence that the quoter <br />
    has read it in the source.</p>
<p>Principle 3 (for quoters)<br />
    Whenever you make a quotation, give the exact source.</p>
<p>Principle 4 (for quoters)<br />
    Only quote from works that you have read.<br />
</pre><br />
I was particularily interested in the first two principles, which in effect <br />
advise readers not to trust information available on the web.<br />
<p><br />
The title of this post, &#8220;When bad men combine&#8230;&#8221; is part of an actual Edmund <br />
Burke quote <b><sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></b>, which I have taken out of context.  You could easily <br />
read my usage to mean that &#8220;bloggers&#8221; (like myself, in this context) are &#8220;bad men&#8221; <br />
and that the combination of their efforts leads to the viral spread of <br />
misinformation on the web.  This is, of course, completely unrelated to <br />
the point Burke was trying to make when he used this quote in a speech to <br />
the British Parliament:<br />
<blockquote><br />
When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by <br />
one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>But, how are <i>you</i> supposed to know that?  If you&#8217;ve never heard <br />
of him before this, how can you be sure that Edmund Burke ever even existed?<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In December, we went to the city of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India with Kelly&#8217;s <br />
mother and sister.  It was an amazing place.  Incredibly different from being <br />
in South India.  I guess it must be something like the difference for <br />
foreigners in the <span class="caps">USA</span> going from Wisconsin to New Mexico.  Completely <br />
different cultures, language, and animals (camels!).  <br />
<P><br />
As we drove there from Agra, I kept looking at the map and noticing how much <br />
closer we were getting to Pakistan.  I don&#8217;t know why, but I get more <br />
interested in visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan every day.  I can&#8217;t think <br />
of many good reasons to go there these days, and there plenty of reasons <br />
<i>not</i> to go.  Still, I can&#8217;t get over the infatuation.  <br />
<P><br />
We took a taxi down (I couldn&#8217;t talk the family into going by camel cart) <br />
to the main shopping area in Jaipur to feed our collective addition to <i>consumption of goods</i>.  For some reason, no matter where we go in India, <br />
I&#8217;m always drawn toward the back alleys.  From one small, cramped street <br />
to a smaller and more cramped one until there are no choices to <br />
turn around and go back.<br />
<P><br />
Everyone else went into a saree shop, so I took the opportunity to <br />
start my regular descent into the depths of the Indian shopping streets.  <br />
I didn&#8217;t get very far when I noticed a saxophone hanging in a window.  <br />
I stopped and asked (in Hindi&#8212;no English here) for the price.  It was <br />
about $10.  Not bad for an alto saxophone, even if it needs some work.  <br />
I decided not to buy it, and walked back to the saree shop to meet up with <br />
the family.  A minute or two later, a man approached me, inviting me back <br />
to the small music shop.  I&#8217;m thinking &#8220;Oh great, now they&#8217;re going to try <br />
to bargain with me&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really mind.  The best time for me to <br />
practice Hindi is when people are annoying me.  The more annoying the person, <br />
the better.  I lose any inhibitions I might have of making mistakes, and <br />
just dig right into it.<br />
<P><br />
It turns out they just wanted me to come back and talk to them.  By the time <br />
I got back to the shop, the number of people there had grown from 3 to about <br />
15.  Apparently, they were all members of the <B>Rajasthan Brass Band</B>.  <br />
They proudly showed me the official band photos on the wall, and introduced <br />
me to the band&#8217;s conductor.  They insisted that I come in and sit down with <br />
them for a solo trumpet performance by one of their star players.  He played <br />
a rousing version of <i>Brazil</i>.<br />
<P><br />
Before I left, they asked that we all pose for a picture together with me <br />
awkwardly holding the $10 saxophone.  Kelly took this photo, which they asked <br />
for us to send to them (we still owe them a copy).<br />
