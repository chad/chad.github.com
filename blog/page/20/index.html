According to a new survey by the <a href="http://www.simnet.org/">Society<br />
for Information Management</a>, <em>business</em> leaders in IT want<br />
employees who have <em>business</em> skills. Shocking, I know.</p>
<pre>
        &amp;quot;These weren't interviews with business managers or HR, these were the
        CIOs themselves, and so it's very interesting that they are putting
        such a high value on skills to help their business rather than just
        hiring the most technical person they can find&amp;quot;, Kaiser said.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Very interesting? What is the purpose of an employee if not to help the<br />
business that employs them?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You can try to hide it or dress it up as something more palatable, but<br />
they&#8217;ll sniff it out and they&#8217;ll condemn it for what it is:<br />
Marketing. Geeks hate marketing.</p>
<p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammers.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went<br />
to India</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  A lot of software developers---especially the most conceited ones, it
  seems---live with the misconception that their skill should be self-evident
  to any clued-in manager or employer. They are able to comfortably veil this
  lie inside the cloud of a make believe moral ethic: theyre just too humble
  to market their own abilities. Going out of their way to make their abiliities
  known would be brown nosing. And, no self-respecting programmer would
  be caught dead sucking up to The Man.

  This is all just an excuse. Actually, they're afraid.
</pre>
<p>
<p>You see, it&#8217;s <em>comfortable</em> to condemn any kind of<br />
self-promotional activity. It&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s common. It&#8217;s<br />
the way of the flock.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Like one of those silly &quot;Question Reality&quot; bumper stickers,<br />
it&#8217;s just conformist behaviour dressed up in such a way that people<br />
who like to think of themselves as nonconformists can feel good about it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s fear of rejection.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But fear of rejection stops us from putting ourselves in situations where<br />
we <em>can</em> be rejected. The opposite of rejection is acceptance. And<br />
in an economy, acceptance is success.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If we want this profession of software development to thrive, we&#8217;re<br />
going to have to hand-hold or beat this mentality out of our people.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I promise. It&#8217;ll only hurt for a little while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a>, I stress the importance of writing as a way to build your<br />
personal brand and make yourself more marketable. I specifically suggest<br />
that software developers open a weblog.</p>
<p>
<p>Marketing maverick <a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> just <a
href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/whos_there_the_.html">published<br />
a free ebook</a> called &quot;Who&#8217;s There?&quot; that goes into much<br />
greater depth about the how and why of blogging.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Why bother? Seth says:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        If you care about your personal brand and career and impact, you need a
        blog. And you should start the cycle of getting better at blogging.
</pre>
<p>
<p>A favorite quote:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        When you apply for a job, so do a thousand other people.
        When you see a house listing, so do a thousand other people.
        When you bid on a grilled cheese sandwich on eBay, so do a thousand other people.
</pre>
<p>
<p>mmmm.&#8230;grilled cheese.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/whos_there.pdf">mirrored the book here</a><br />
if you&#8217;re interested. It&#8217;s a short and very worthwhile read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/">Alan Francis</a> is a long time<br />
industry veteran and agile development guru. I met him several years ago<br />
when he was my team&#8217;s coach at Object mentor&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.objectmentor.com/courses/xpImmersion">XP Immersion</a><br />
(taught by Robert Martin, Ron Jeffries, and Kent Beck).</p>
<p>
<p>More recently, he was one of the early draft reviewers of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">my book</a>. He had<br />
the following <a
href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/2005/09/my_job_went_to_.html">to say<br />
about it</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        The book is, in my head at least, a companion volume to Pragmatic
        Programmer. PragProg gave a list of concrete advice for programmers
        to improve their programming. MJWTI (as the new book is affectionately
        known) gives a list of good concrete advice for programmer to improve
        everything else that makes them employable.
</pre>
<p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first comparison between <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic<br />
Programmer</a> that I&#8217;ve heard, and I hope it won&#8217;t be the<br />
last. Since reading it in 2000, The Pragmatic Programmer has been on my<br />
short list of books I recommend to every programmer I work with, because<br />
being a programmer and <em>not</em> having read it is a crime. It just has<br />
too much to offer the average programmer <a
href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/2296">to go unread</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If <span class="caps">MJWTI</span> can help as many people in as profound a way, the investment will<br />
have been well worth it to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are now sample chapters <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">available</a>, and<br />
the book can be pre-ordered (the <span class="caps">PDF</span> ships <em>now</em>, and the paper copy<br />
ships at the end of this month). I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts as<br />
you read it (even just the sample chapters). <a

Much to my delight, he chose to record an excerpt from the introduction to<br />
<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> (<span class="caps">MJWTI</span>). It&#8217;s the very beginning of the book which tells<br />
the story of my first experiences in India (My job <em>did</em> go to<br />
India. I went with it).</p>
<p>
<p>Listening to my own words read by someone else (and really well, I might<br />
add) is <em>bizarre</em>. I think the book might actually be better this<br />
way. I could also smell the idlis and sambar (maybe I&#8217;m just hungry).</p>

<p>
<p><a href="http://www.toolshed.com/downloads/podcasts/MJWTIIntro.mp3">Give it<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to Randstad, only <a
href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/24/pf/workplace_morale/index.htm?section=money_pf">40<br />
percent of employees feel that morale is good at their workplace</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>Think about the last time you were in a bad morale situation at work (for<br />
60% percent of you, that&#8217;s right now). How good was your performance?<br />
How good a job do you do when you&#8217;re not happy with what you&#8217;re<br />
doing or who you&#8217;re doing it for?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ll answer for you. You do a mediocre job at best. Most likely, you<br />
do a poor job.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If I want someone to do a mediocre job, I&#8217;m going to look for the<br />
cheapest available option. In programming terms, that means low hourly<br />
rate. In today&#8217;s environment, low hourly rate means India, China, the<br />
Phillipines or some other &quot;low cost country&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Is our morale low because we&#8217;re being squeezed for more work at lower<br />
wages and because we&#8217;re constantly facing the threat of being<br />
offshored? Or are we constantly facing the threat of being offshored<br />
<em>because</em> our morale is low, and we are doing, collectively, a<br />
mediocre job?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Registration for the <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">Fifth International<br />

<p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/agenda.html">the<br />

<p>This is a great chance to meet Matz and many of the leaders of the Ruby<br />

<p>Even if you&#8217;re not speaking, bring your ideas. Some big ideas (and<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a followup to my <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/LoveItOrLeaveIt.rdoc,v">previous<br />
post</a>, Tim Case has <a
href="http://karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/24/love-it-or-leave-it-indeed">posted<br />
an inspirational story</a> about having the courage to take control of his<br />
own career as a software developer.</p>
<p>
<p>Frustrated by the software industry and the job market, Tim (like many<br />
software developers, I&#8217;d bet) struggled with whether to find a new<br />
line of work altogether. Here&#8217;s a cliffhanger for you:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  I didn't want to leave because I was learning
  more about software and each new thing I learned made me want to keep
  learning more but I also couldn't keep throwing myself into the winds
  of marketplace expectations.  I gave up on trying to get lucky and find
  that dream job.

  So what did I do?
</pre>
<p>
<p>He took matters into his own hands. Give it a read.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I also stumbled across Kathy Sierra&#8217;s <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/you_20.html">You<br />
2.0</a> post on the always thought-provoking <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users">Creating<br />
Passionate Users</a> weblog.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The common theme is that it&#8217;s never too late to take control of your<br />
destiny. Most people just never realize it&#8217;s even <em>possible</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Do you have a similar story? I&#8217;d love to <a
href="mailto:chad+loveitorleaveit@chadfowler.com">hear about it</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in a <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Writing/MyJobWentToIndiaDone.rdoc,v">previous<br />
post</a>, though my goal was to help others, the process of writing <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> has already helped <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>
<p>While living in Bangalore, I saw <a
href="http://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> speak at a<br />
Thoughtworks-sponsored event on agile development. The one thing he said<br />
that has stuck with me since then is that when he wants to learn about<br />
something, he writes about it. It&#8217;s obvious that writing a book or an<br />
essay on a topic would help you learn about it, but it never occurred to me<br />
that these guru-authors might be writing about things that they<br />
didn&#8217;t already know before starting a book or article. Writing is<br />
both a process of documentation <tt>and</tt> discovery.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense when you&#8217;re writing about a technology.<br />
There are bound to be nooks and crannies that you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
explored, even if you&#8217;re an expert. To present a complete picture,<br />
you&#8217;re going to have to dig into things you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
had a need for.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What wasn&#8217;t as obvious to me was that the same would be true of<br />
non-tech writing. My book isn&#8217;t a reference manual. It&#8217;s a<br />
collection of bits of advice. It&#8217;s less about knowledge and more<br />
about common sense, good judgement, and wisdom. So the nooks and crannies I<br />
explored as I wrote weren&#8217;t in obscure language features or rarely<br />
touched APIs. They were in concepts that I had either taught myself or had<br />
absorbed through osmosis from the wiser people around me throughout my<br />
career.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>While I was codifying ideas that had been everyday companions to me for<br />
years, they went from being rough and ragged to polished. Not only were<br />
they clearer for my readers (the purpose of the polishing) but they were<br />
actually <em>better</em>. As a result I have produced advice that, at least<br />
on a granular level, is new to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this one particular section of my book that I learned a<br />
<em>lot</em> from. I&#8217;ve read it many times since it was written, and<br />
I&#8217;ve thought about it even more. It&#8217;s called &quot;Love it or<br />
Leave it&quot;. The premise is that, if you don&#8217;t love what<br />
you&#8217;re doing, you won&#8217;t be <em>great</em> at it. Or to flip it<br />
around, if you love your job, you stand a much greater chance of being<br />
great at it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Stated alone like this, it couldn&#8217;t get any more obvious. But this<br />
book is about making things actionable. I realized as I thought about it<br />
that I was unable to come up with a recent personal example of how<br />
<em>I</em> had taken this most primitive piece of advice and done something<br />
about it. My career had taken a turn that most Americans would consider to<br />
be &quot;success&quot;, and I had let it take me where it wanted. That<br />
meant management in big corporations.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But the undercurrent that was always tugging on me was that I looked at a<br />
lot of my friends in the industry with a feeling of envy. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could (at least attempt to) innovate all day. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could write Ruby code full time. I wished <em>I</em> could work<br />
in an environment that was 100% focused on getting things done instead of<br />
drifting in the tides of corporate politics. I wanted to work for a company<br />
that was focused on <em>winning</em> instead of trying not to<br />
<em>lose</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So I decided to take my own advice and find this environment I&#8217;d been<br />
looking for. On the same day that I decided to look, I <a
href="http://naviance.com">found it</a>. <a
href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> and I are moving to Denver, so<br />
that I can be a full time Ruby (on <a
href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>) developer for Naviance.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Several years in the big corporate world creates a lot of inertia.<br />
It&#8217;s no easy decision to make. But it feels <em>right</em> once<br />
it&#8217;s done, and the interactions I&#8217;ve had with my new team only<br />
serve to reinforce my choice.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The team is going to stay small and focused. We&#8217;re looking for a <a
href="http://www.naviance.com/company/webdes.html">designer with Rails<br />
experience</a>. Might this be the leap you&#8217;ve been waiting to make?</p>
