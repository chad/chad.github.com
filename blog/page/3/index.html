  <div class="entry-content"><p>You instinctively know that who you associate with matters a lot.  Our parents bring us up steering away and toward others who influence us.</p>
<p>But most of us don&#8217;t realize just how much those around us influence us.</p>
<p>As I recall in the introduction to <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a>, there was one specific event that turned the tide for me.  I had been chugging along in my slightly-above-average corporate job and experiencing what I considered to be the height of success.  Then I had an intense period during which, for a few months, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a whole new level of software developers.  It all came to a head when I went to the eXtreme Programming Immersion that Object Mentor taught.  After a week surrounded by brilliant developers and leaders in the field, I knew I had to do something different.</p>
<p>I had to be as much like them as I could.</p>
<p>In The Passionate Programmer, I quote Pat Metheny&#8217;s advice to young musicians: always be the worst musician in every band you&#8217;re in.  As a musician and as a programmer, I&#8217;ve tried Pat&#8217;s advice.  You play with a group of people better than you, and you&#8217;ll almost always play better.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3315/3613370192_30635de1cb_m.jpg" alt="" /><br />
http://www.flickr.com/photos/jazzuality/3613370192/</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good anecdotal advice.  If you don&#8217;t trust Pat, how about <a href="http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/">Nicholas Christakis</a>?  Nicholas is a social scientist at Harvard University.  Together with James Fowler of UC San Diego, his research focuses on how behavior and then even <span class="caps">EMOTION</span> spread through social networks.  Can behavior be epidemic?</p>
<p>Here are some things their research has shown to spread through social networks ilke disease:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/health/25cnd-fat.html?_r=1&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=nicholas%20christakis&amp;st=cse">Obesity</a>), <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0706154">Smoking</a>, <a href="http://www.annals.org/content/152/7/426.abstract">Alcohol Consumption</a>, and….<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2338.full"><span class="caps">HAPPINESS</span></a>!  Yes, emotional state is contagious.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/48/165829023_8e97572f07_o.jpg" alt="" /><br />
http://www.flickr.com/photos/saintbob/165829023/</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t insignificant numbers, either.  For example, obesity chances increase 57% if you have a friend who is or becomes obese.  And, more disturbing than that, this is an effect that is conducted through more than one node in the social graph.  If your friends&#8217; friends&#8217; friends are obese, <a href="http://bit.ly/eOY1LP">you are 10% more likely to be obese</a></p>
<p>If behavior spreads through social networks, then working in a toxic or slow-moving corporate environment is really really bad for you.  If you&#8217;re a consultant, you <span class="caps">MUST</span> fire the clients that bring you down a notch and seek out clients that pull you up.  If you&#8217;re a teacher, go where the students care about what they&#8217;re learning.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What&#8217;s the difference between automation and outsourcing?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same everywhere, but here in the <span class="caps">USA</span> we&#8217;re deluged with fear-driven &#8220;news&#8221; reporting, decrying the theft or export of our jobs to low cost, less skilled, offshore labor.  Or even onshore &#8220;illegal&#8221; labor.  It might be Mexico. Or China. Or India.  In the 80s it was the Japanese. And it was robots and computers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to argue whether any of this is true or worth being upset about here.  <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">I&#8217;ve done it elsewhere.</a>  What I&#8217;m interested in here is the question: what if, as individuals, instead of fearing outsourcing, offshoring, and automation, we decided to use it to our advantage?</p>
<p>The standard argument against offshore outsourcing goes like this:  Offshore people don&#8217;t understand the work, or the culture, or don&#8217;t care about quality or just aren&#8217;t as good.  They might be cheaper by the hour, but they&#8217;re more expensive in the long run.</p>
<p>OK.  That&#8217;s a hard one to disprove.  It&#8217;s also kind of hard to prove.  Regardless, hold that thought</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/16/21042744_0640512665.jpg" alt="" /><br />
http://www.flickr.com/photos/dancoulter/21042744/</p>
<p>In this day and age, we&#8217;ve collectively gotten over the fear that computers will replace us all.  We&#8217;re used to the idea that certain tasks can and should be automated.  For the younger readers, did you know that there was such thing as a spreadsheet before computer existed?  That&#8217;s right.  It was roughly the same except a <em>person</em> had to calculate each value!  And if any numbers changed, guess what happened?  Someone had to recalculate them!</p>
<p>Anybody want that job?  I didn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s automation.  If you think <em>really</em> hard about what you do every day, I bet you can come up with a few things that could be automated so you wouldn&#8217;t have to do them anymore.  You wouldn&#8217;t feel bad about those things.  You&#8217;d be saving yourself time and saving your employers money if you could automate them.  Software developers spend their careers doing this for others.</p>
<p>Anything that could be done by a computer or a robot (roughly) just as well as it could be done by a human should be automated.  That frees the people up to <em>think</em>.  That&#8217;s what we want, ya?  Hurray!</p>
<p>Some tasks are almost automate-able.  But they just need that little extra push.  For example, human language is hard to parse.  It&#8217;s not exact enough to write reliable programs (usually) to read and act on.  So what do you do with those tasks that seem mundane enough to automate but can&#8217;t actually be done without a human?</p>
<p>Outsource!</p>
<p>Outsourcing might mean giving the task to a more junior person you already work with. It might mean hiring someone on another continent who costs a fraction per hour than you do and can be trained to do the mundane work you do.  It might mean taking on <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596518387">an apprentice</a> and teaching them as they handle the &#8220;easy&#8221; stuff.</p>
<p>But, the fact of the matter is, in the work that most of us do every day there are things we could have someone less experienced do for us. And if that person is happy to do it, benefits from it in some way, costs less than we do, or is just <em>willing</em> when we are not, it&#8217;s not a bad thing to try.</p>
<p>If you continually do things that are &#8220;below your pay grade&#8221;, you&#8217;re wasting precious time or money.</p>
<p>At the end of the day today, think about what you did today.  Given a little time, how much of it could have been automated?</p>
<p>Given a little time to document what needed to be done, how much of it could have been done just as well by someone else who is maybe less skilled or less expensive than you?</p></div>

<p>The presentation is called &#8220;McDonalds, Six Sigma, and Offshore Outsourcing &#8211; Unexpected Sources of Insight&#8221;.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We software developers like to think of what we do as an art form (or a craft, if you&#8217;re at this conference). I was once asked to come up with a set of guidelines for creating great software so our (huge) company could more effectively use an offshore development team that had been delivering amorphous piles of crummy, nonworking code. I was frustrated and responded with something like this: &#8220;Give me a list of guidelines for how to make a beautiful song!&#8221; The nerve! Repeatable processes? Who did she think she was talking to?! This is a creative process! This is <span class="caps">ART</span>!!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve since grown up a bit and I&#8217;d like to talk about how I was wrong and how we can all hopefully learn from my mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/></p>
<p>
<p>In it, I tell the story of my experiences with the Six Sigma quality methodology and with offshore outsourcing, urging developers not to blindly write off potentially useful software development strategies based on hearsay and misunderstanding. I also propose a customer-driven, data-driven approach to software engineering, dovetailing off of InfoEther&#8217;s Chief Scientist, <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/blog">Glenn Vanderburg&#8217;s</a> recent ruminations on <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/282-lsrc2010-real-software-engineering">&#8220;Real Software Engineering&#8221;</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: We got 8 times as many volunteers for Rails 3 Recipes reviews as we need.  You people are awesome!  Closing the call for help now.</b></p>
<p>The original <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_rr/rails-recipes">Rails Recipes</a> has been used by tens of thousands of Rails developers as they&#8217;ve worked toward mastering everyone&#8217;s favorite Web framework.  Five years later, and after the release of Rails 3, we&#8217;re seeing a new wave of Rails developers.  Through my work with <a href="http://infoether.com">InfoEther</a> and <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com">The Pragmatic Studio</a> it&#8217;s clear that an updated version of this classic would help a huge group of new Rails developers.</p>
<p>So here comes Rails 3 Recipes!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little over half way done with the new edition, which is full of both substantially updated and entirely new content.  Now I need your help.</p>
<p>Before we take the book to Beta, we need technical reviewers.  To tech review, you need to either already know Rails fairly well or be interested in trying to use the book to learn (some Rails knowledge is assumed).</p>
<p>In return for your comments, we&#8217;ll give you a free copy of the electronic and paper versions of the book as well as a mention in the book itself.</p>
<p>Interested?  If so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:rails3recipes@gmail.com">rails3recipes@gmail.com</a> and let us know your level of Rails expertise.  We can only handle a certain number of reviewers (probably 15), so we&#8217;ll be limited to accepting the first who get in touch.</p>
<p>To those who are interested, <span class="caps">THANK</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span>!!!!!!</p>
<p>If the original Rails Recipes&#8217; success is any indicator, Rails 3 Recipes is going to be <em>the</em> book every Rails developer will have sitting on his or her desk over the next couple of years. I&#8217;m very excited about it and looking forward to some feedback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wanting to survey what the current state of the art in Rails Ajax development is, I asked this question on twitter:</p>

	<li><a href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js">mustache.js</a></li>
	<li>Sending JavaScript back down to the client using .js.erb template files (Ryan Bates linked a couple of examples <a href="http://bit.ly/YCunh">here</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/dHbKW5">here</a>)</li>

	<li>Hitting <span class="caps">RESTFUL</span> endpoints and responding with <span class="caps">JSON</span> data to be manipulated on the client</li>
	<li>Using <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone">backbone.js</a></li>
	<li>Rendering partials and updating elements on the page with their raw content (the original old-school Rails way of doing it)</li>
	<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/mrb/sammyonrails">SammyOnRails</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is definitely a divide and a lot of opinion (suprise!) between those who are OK with delivering JavaScript and/or <span class="caps">HTML</span> from the server to be rendered on the client and those who prefer to deliver data and have the client process it.  I&#8217;d characterize the former as the less clean, more pragmatic approach and the latter as the idealistic cleaner approach.  It seems that tools like mustache.js, backbone, JQuery templates, and Sammy.js are tightening the gap between quick + dirty and slow + clean.</p>
<p>What do you think?  What did we miss?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the pleasure of watching <a href="http://scottchacon.com/">Scott Chacon</a> keynote at <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> this week. He spoke about how <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> &#8220;manages&#8221; its development team and product development.  I enjoyed the talk, and encourage you to download his <a href="https://github.com/schacon/ddd">slides</a> if you weren&#8217;t at the conference.</p>
<p>Scott is a very energetic speaker and talks really fast, so he ended his keynote with a lot of time to spare (something I wish I would do more often). So he took questions from the audience.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions were about trying to fit Github&#8217;s process into companies of very different profiles.  So, for example, &#8220;Would this work in blah blah blah environment that is totally different from Github?&#8221;  Scott&#8217;s answer was excellent in these several cases:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t blow the questions off. He then discussed possibilities.  But it was incredibly refreshing to hear &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; from a speaker being questioned in front of an audience of almost 1000 people.</p>
<p>I wrote in <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2">The Passionate Programmer</a> about the difficulty and importance of learning to say &#8220;no&#8221;. I think &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; is scarier and harder and maybe more important.</p>
<p>When someone regularly says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;, you trust them more when they say they DO know.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome? It&#8217;s a name given to the condition wherein hostages develop positive feelings toward their captors despite being held in negative, unfavorable and even life-threatening conditions.  Victims of Stockholm Syndrome will even inexplicably stay with their captors even when given the chance at freedom.</p>
<p>Hopefully nobody reading this is literally being held hostage right now. If you are, good luck!</p>
<p>For the rest of you, why might I suggest that you are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome? Because employment relationships can manifest themselves in this very way.</p>
<p>In the article, <a href="http://drjoecarver.makeswebsites.com/clients/49355/File/love_and_stockholm_syndrome.html">Love and Stockholm Syndrome: The Mystery of Loving an Abuser</a>, Dr. Joseph Carver says that the following four situations serve as a foundation for the development of Stockholm Syndrome:</p>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<ul>
	<li>The presence of a perceived threat to oneâ€™s physical or psychological survival and the belief that the abuser would carry out the threat.</li>
	<li>The presence of a perceived small kindness from the abuser to the victim</li>
	<li>Isolation from perspectives other than those of the abuser</li>
	<li>The perceived inability to escape the situation</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>Looking back at my own career (specifically some of the extremely intelligent people I&#8217;ve met who are stagnating in oppressive companies or positions) I have recognized that many of these people (and sometimes myself) have felt &#8220;stuck&#8221; for no obvious reason. Some people seem just plain crazy when you look at their skill sets, ability, and the low quality of work or environment they&#8217;re willing to put up with.</p>
<p>So I contacted Joseph Carver to ask his opinion. Could this be Stockholm Syndrome?  He agreed. In email, he said &#8220;SS is most likely to develop when the employee feels trapped, perhaps by a high salary, fear of losing a career, or fear of humiliation.&#8221;  So let&#8217;s look at his four conditions:</p>
<h2>Perceived threat:</h2>
<p>Getting fired, being humiliated, not being a &#8220;top 20%&#8221; employee, not getting a raise. Employers wield a lot of perceived power over employees, especially for those in very traditional corporate jobs.  The employer <em>must</em> be willing to carry out the threat. Every business is under the right conditions. It&#8217;s how businesses work.</p>
<h2>Small kindness</h2>
<p>Got a Christmas bonus once when you really needed it? Make a competitive salary? Great benefits? Get to work on a technology you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to work on elsewhere?  There ya go.</p>
<h2>Isolation from other perspectives</h2>
<p>Again, a big corporate environment is <em>ripe</em> for this kind of isolation.  If you work for BigCo, you learn to do things The BigCo way.  The company&#8217;s organizational structure becomes a blueprint for your career progression.  You start to lose sight of what industry pay and incentives look like since you have a homogeneous population to compare with. Unfortunately, from what I&#8217;ve seen even the <em>best</em> run companies create this kind of isolation of perspective and group-think. Charismatic leaders are particularly capable of creating a culture vacuum around a cult of personality.</p>
<h2>Perceived inability to escape</h2>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, American adults <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.htm">spend by far more time working than any other activity.</a>  That&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of your waking time being trapped in a routine. In a Stockholm Syndrome situation, the captor chips away at the self-esteem of the captive. So for most of our waking hours, those of us trapped in dead end jobs like these are exposed to environments which systematically destroy our self-confidence.  Not only that, a persistent fear and feeling of failure makes it harder to actually explore the options for leaving the bad situation. The instinctive self-preservation reaction in this kind of situation is to work <em>harder</em> to try to avoid the perceived threat coming to fruition.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what if this describes your job?  You owe it to yourself to find a way out. Hopefully recognizing the signs will show you that the <em>real</em> situation is far less grim than you might believe and that you have control over how you choose to spend the <em>majority</em> of your adult life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing this for the many people I&#8217;ve met (and the countless I haven&#8217;t) that are senselessly stuck in bad job situations. Please stop wasting your precious time.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I asked this question on twitter:<br />
<pre><br />
Software developers: how do you know when it&#8217;s the right time to do a big software rewrite?<br />
</pre></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written about this topic before (<a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">The Big Rewrite</a>). I&#8217;m revisiting it for a presentation <a href="http://infoether.com">Rich Kilmer</a> and I are doing this weekend at <a href="http://jrubyconf.com">JRubyConf</a>.</p>
<p>I got a bunch of replies. Some serious, some sarcastic, some obviously filtered through the jading effects of a few Big Rewrites played out.  The answer ranged from &#8220;<span class="caps">NEVER</span>!&#8221; to &#8220;as soon as you feel like it&#8217;s necessary&#8221;.  The one consistent theme is that software rewrites are scary and the decision shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Drivers include maintenance cost, programmer happiness, politics, and fear.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the developers on Twitter said:</p>
<p><div><a href='http://twitter.com/insanity_rocks'><img width='40' src='http://a1.twimg.com/profile_images/1116024529/little-domo-suk128_normal.jpg'/><br />

<p></div> seriously, though, i believe when you lose confidence implementing changes it&#8217;s probably a good time to consider a rewrite</p>

<p></div> However, before beginning a big rewrite, you need to &#8220;fix&#8221; the management responsible for a codebase that needs a big rewrite.</p>

<p></div> Must consider context, so right answer is &#8220;it depends&#8221;.  But the raising of the question itself is probably an indicator.</p>

a rewrite takes less time and has less risks involved than a functional conversion but results in lower quality as well.<br />
by functional conversion I mean a rewrite-from-scratch scenario, and by &#8220;rewrite&#8221; I meant &#8220;refactoring&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was scrolling through articles on this site earlier, and I decided to re-read some of my own encouraging words for a shot of inspiration.  On the post called <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2009/5/2/what-would-you-rather-be-doing">What Would You Rather Be Doing?</a> I came across this comment by <a href="http://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a> and wanted to make sure everyone saw it.</p>

  Imagine youâ€™re hit by a car today, wake up in the hospital, and the doctor is saying, â€œSorry. We canâ€™t stop the bleeding. Youâ€™ve only got an hour to live.â€
  
  Youâ€™re laying on what you now realize is your death bed. Oh no! No no no! All those things you wanted to do! You never went to Italy! You never started       
  that business you knew would be a huge success! You never asked-out that gorgeous person you flirt with! You never flew ZeroG. You never lost 30 
  pounds and got proud of your looks. You never had kids.
  
  
  Make that list.
  
  Then make it your to-do list.
  
  Eliminate all those potential regrets.
</pre>
<p>Thanks, Derek!</p></div>
