    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I keep learning this lesson over and over again, so I&#8217;m writing it here in an effort to never forget again. As a manager, if some task constantly stresses me out or makes me feel uneasy,
it&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m doing someone else&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean someone&#8217;s being lazy and I&#8217;m picking up their slack. I&#8217;m talking about those nagging little annoying things you find yourself doing as infrequently as you can
and do a half-assed job at every time. So you not only stress because they&#8217;re in the way of your <i>real</i> work but you stress because you suck at them.</p>

<p>Every time I allow myself to notice this feeling&#8211;every time I  analyze what&#8217;s causing it, it&#8217;s because I should be delegating this work to someone else. Usually, in a
mature organization, it&#8217;s even obvious <i>who</i> the work should go to.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about being a manager of people is that your core job includes uncluttering your and everyone else&#8217;s work days by putting the work, moving tasks to a home  where they can be
lovingly completed.</p>
