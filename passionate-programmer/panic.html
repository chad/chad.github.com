<hr />

<p id="N10E65">
  I started my career as a computer programmer because of video games. Since the days of loading games from tape
  on my Commodore 64, I’ve been hooked by their immersive, interactive experiences. I used to be embarrassed to admit it, but I realize
  now that it’s nothing to be ashamed of. For me, computer games turned
  the on-screen environment (the operating system, I guess) into an
  environment I was comfortable and excited about.</p>


<p id="N10E68">
  My favorite game ever was id Software’s Doom. I was specifically
  in love with the one-on-one, player-vs.-player, death-match part of the
  game. Players would connect via modem or serial connection and battle
  each other in small, fast-paced environments. I got really good at
  the Doom death match. I often joke that it might be the thing in my life
  so far that I’m best at. The game of death match is surprisingly complex.
  It’s both technical and psychological—like a frenetic mix of chess
  and fencing on fast-forward.</p>


<p id="N10E6B">
  Like most skills, a great way to get good at it is to watch masters at work.
  Back in my Doom days, there was one such master who went by the ironic online
   handle “Noskill.”  Noskill was the de facto reigning Doom champion. People
  from around North America would pay the long-distance telephone fees to try
  their luck against him. These matches would all be recorded with Doom’s built-in
  game-recording facility.  I watched every one.
    </p>


<p id="N10E6E">
  It didn’t take me long to learn his secret. Sure, he was generally good at the game,
  but there was one obvious key to his success: he never panicked. Doom was the
  kind of game in which a round could be over literally seconds after it started.
  It was really fast. I remember my first death-match game. Spawn, die, spawn, die,
  spawn, die.  When I finally managed to stay alive more than a couple of seconds
  I found myself running around aimlessly, barely able to keep track of where I was.
    </p>


<p id="N10E71">
  But Noskill never acted that way. No matter how difficult the situation, you could
  tell by watching the recordings that he was always relaxed and always thinking
  about what to do next. He was always seemingly aware of how his current context
  fit into the overall shape of the match.
    </p>


<p id="N10E78">
  Now if you think about other games, particularly sports, you’ll recognize that
  the best players all share this quality. In fact, even the characters we admire
  in books, television, and movies share this quality. Heroes never panic. They’re
  always the people who can have a nuclear bomb dropped on their city or crash
  in an airplane and manage to organize a group, help the survivors, outsmart the
  enemy, or at least just not break down in tears.
    </p>


<p id="N10E7B">
  This extends to real life, too. Despite my best planning, my professional life
  has been a string of emergencies and disasters. Projects run really really late.
  Software applications crash, costing my employers money and credibility. I say
  the wrong thing to the wrong vice president and gain a political enemy. Most of
  the time, these things come in waves all together, never one at a time.
    </p>


<p id="N10E7E">
  In my worst moments, I panic. I lock up and can think tactically at best. I react
  to each small input without the clarity to consider the big picture.
    </p>


<p id="N10E81">
  But looking back on literally <span class="emph">every</span> such disaster, not a single
  one has made a lasting, noticeable impact on me or my career. So, as panicked or
  depressed or upset as I’ve gotten over these seemingly disastrous situations,
  not one has been a <span class="emph">true</span> disaster.
    </p>


<p id="N10E8A">
  What did the panicking give me? What was the advantage of reacting negatively
  to each of these situations? Nothing. What panicking really gave me was an inability
  to perform at my best at the times I really <span class="emph">needed</span> to be performing
  at my best.
    </p>


<p id="N10E90">
    Now I have to admit that not panicking in stressful situations is easier said than done.
    It’s kind of like telling someone “just be happy.”  Sure, it’s good advice, but how
      do you do it? How do you avoid panicking when things seem to be falling apart?  To answer this question, it
      helps to think a little about why we <span class="emph">do</span> panic.
  </p>


<p id="N10E96">
    We panic because we lose perspective. When something is going wrong, it’s hard not to focus
    all attention on the problem. To some extent, that’s a good way to solve problems. Unfortunately,
    it also makes the problem, no matter how small, seem more important than it is. And with the
    problem inflated and stress levels running high, our brains turn themselves off.
  </p>


<p id="N10E99">
    Who is the worst computer user you know? For me, it’s probably one of my parents or in-laws (I know who,
      but I’m smart enough not to name any names here). Imagine that person sitting at their computer
      trying to finish a project when an error message start popping up with everything they try to do.
      We’ve all seen this happen. Inexperienced computer users get quickly frustrated and freaked out.
      They start hectically clicking and dragging things around on the screen, ignoring the potentially
      helpful error message text as it pops up over and over again. They eventually get so flustered
      that they have to call for help, but usually not before messing up one or two additional things
      on the computer before doing so.
    </p>


<p id="N10E9C">
    Don’t think I’m mean, but I want you to picture this situation with someone appropriate you know
    as the main character, and I want you to laugh to yourself about it. This kind of behavior really
    is ridiculous, isn’t it? It’s laughable.
  </p>


<p id="N10E9F">
    But, as genuinely funny as this is, what we just imagined was a real-life scenario in which a person
    working outside their comfort zone encountered a problem and panicked. It’s no different from the way
      I’ve reacted when projects have run late or I’ve accidentally crashed a system or I’ve dissatisfied a
    customer on the job.  It’s just a different context.
  </p>


<p id="N10EA2">
    So, here’s how I’m learning to not panic. When something bad happens and I start to feel that sinking, stressed-out
    feeling that leads to panic, I compare myself to the frustrated computer-illiterate, and I laugh at myself.
    I analyze the situation from the third-person perspective, as if I’m helping that frustrated family member
    with their word processing disaster. Seemingly hard problems are suddenly easier. Seemingly bad situations are suddenly
    not so bad. And, I often find that the solution simple and staring me in the face in the same way that
    an error dialog often tells you exactly what to do next.  If you’d just have the presence of mind to read
    the error message, the problem might be solved.
  </p>


<h3>Act on It!</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<p id="N10EAB">Keep a panic journal. The key to catching panic before it happens is to develop a heightened real-time awareness of your perception and emotions as they happen. I’ve had my best luck learning to do this by analyzing my reactions to situations after the fact. I’m not smart enough to naturally keep a background thread running and analyzing my thoughts as they happen, but I’ve discovered that if I practice the analysis “offline,” I get better and better at doing the analysis in real time.</p>
<p id="N10EAE">
          Saying you’re going to do a better job of analyzing your reactions and actually doing it are two different things. Keeping a journal will help add structure to the process. Each day at a specific time (use a calendar with a reminder!), open up a text file and record any situation that caused you to panic, even if only a little bit. Once a week, look back on the past week’s list and take stock of the lasting impact of each panic-inducing situation.  Was the situation panic-worthy?  What would have been the most productive reaction to the situation? What would the hero in a dramatized movie about your life have done instead of panicking?
          </p>
<p id="N10EB1">
          After some practice, you’ll find the analysis to start happening <span class="emph">while</span> the panic sets in. As you rationally explore the reasons for your panic in real time, you’ll find that the panic itself takes a backseat and eventually dissipates.
        </p>
</li>
</ol>
