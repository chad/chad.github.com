I'm Chad Fowler.  I write books, write and play music, write software, speak, teach, learn, organize conferences, etc.

I started and co-organized a couple of Ruby-related conferences including <a href="http://rubyconf.org">The International Ruby Conference</a> and <a href="http:/railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>.

This is what I look like:
