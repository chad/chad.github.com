I'm Chad Fowler.  I [write books](http://chadfowler.com/books/), [write and play music](http://soundcloud.com/chad-fowler), write software (currently for [6Wunderkinder, in Berlin](http://6wunderkinder.com)), [speak](http://chadfowler.com/speaking/), [teach](http://pragmaticstudio.com/), learn, organize conferences, etc.

I started and co-organized a couple of Ruby-related conferences including <a href="http://rubyconf.org">The International Ruby Conference</a> and <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>.

This is what I look like:
