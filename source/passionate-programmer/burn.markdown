<p id="N10D4D"> One of the many sources of controversy around the Extreme
      Programming movement is its initial assertion that team members
      should work no more than forty hours per week. This kind of talk
      really upsets slave-driving managers who want to squeeze as much
      productivity as possible from their teams. It even kind of
      upset programmers themselves. The number of hours worked
      continuously becomes part of the developer machismo, like how
      many beers a frat boy can chug at a kegger. </p>
<p id="N10D53"> Bob
      Martin,
    one of the Extreme Programming community’s
      luminaries, turned the phrase around in a way that made it much
      more tolerable for both parties while staying true to Kent
      Beck’s original intent. Martin renamed <span class="emph">forty-hour workweek</span>
      to “eight-hour burn.” The idea is that
      you should work so relentlessly that there is no way that you
      could continue longer than eight hours. </p>
<p id="N10D5F"> Before we go too deeply into the burn, why the emphasis on
      keeping the number of hours down anyway? This chapter is about
      getting things done. Shouldn’t we be talking about working
        <span class="emph">more</span> hours? </p>
<p id="N10D65"> When it comes to work, less really can be more. The primary
      reason cited by the Extreme Programmers is that when we’re
      tired, we can’t think as effectively as when we’re rested.  When
      we’re burned out, we aren’t as creative, and the quality of our
      work reduces dramatically.  We start making stupid mistakes that
      end up costing us time and money. </p>
<p id="N10D6C"> Most projects last a long time. You can’t keep up the pace of
      a sprint and finish a marathon. Though your short-term
      productivity will significantly increase as you start putting in
      the hours, in the long term you’re going to crash so hard that
      the recovery time will be larger than the productivity gains you
      enjoyed during your eighty-hour weeks. </p>
<p id="N10D6F"> You can also think of your time in the same way you think of
      your money. When I was a teenager, working part-time jobs for
      minimum wage, I would have been happy to live off the amount
      of money that I <span class="emph">waste</span> now. I have so much more
      money available to me now than I did when I was a teenager that
      I tend to be less aware as I spend each dollar.  Somehow, I was
      able to survive back then. I had a place to live, a car to
      drive, and food to eat.</p>
<p id="N10D75">I have the same things today. And, I
      don’t lead a particularly extravagant lifestyle
      now. Apparently, when money was scarce, I found ways to be more
      efficient with my cash. And, the end result was essentially the
      same. </p>
<p id="N10D78"> We treat scarce resources as being more valuable, and we make
      more efficient use of them. In addition to money matters, we can
      also apply this to our time. Think about day 4 of the last seventy-hour
      week you worked. No doubt, you were putting in a valiant
      effort. But, by day 4, you start to get lax with your
      time. <span class="emph">It’s 10:30 a.m., and I know I’m going to be here for
      hours after everyone else goes home. I think I’ll check out the
        latest technology news for a while.</span>
</p>
<p id="N10D7D">When you have too
      much time to work, your work time reduces significantly in
      perceived value. If you have seventy hours available, each hour is
      less precious to you than when you have forty hours available. </p>
<p id="N10D80"> When the value of the dollar suffers from inflation, you need
      more dollars to buy the same stuff. When the value of
      the <span class="emph">hour</span> is deflated, you need more hours
      to <span class="emph">do</span> stuff. Bob Martin’s eight-hour burn places a
      constraint on you and gives you a strategy for dealing with that
      constraint. You get to work and think, <span class="emph">I’ve only got
        eight hours! Go, go, go!</span> With strict barriers on start
      and end times, you naturally start to organize your time more
      effectively. You might start with a set of tasks that need to
      get done for the day, and you lay them out in prioritized order
      and start nailing them one at a time. </p>
<p id="N10D8C"> The eight-hour burn creates an environment that feels
      like that ultraproductive weekend you might have
      occasionally spent in college, cramming for a test in a course
      that you had been neglecting or jamming out a term paper that
      had fallen prey to procrastination. The difference is that this
      is constrained <span class="emph">cramming</span>. Times of cramming are
      usually extremely productive, because time becomes scarce and
      therefore extremely valuable. The eight-hour burn is a method of
      cramming early and often without having to stay up all night
      taking NoDoze and drinking Jolt Cola. </p>
<p id="N10D92"> As thought workers, even if we’re not in front of a computer
      or in the office, we can be working. You might be working while
      you’re driving to dinner with your spouse or while you’re
      watching a movie. Your work is following you around nagging
      you. </p>
<p id="N10D95"> My work usually nags me when I haven’t paid enough attention
      to it. I might be letting a specific task slip or letting tasks
      pile up and not taking care of them. This is when the work
      follows me home and badgers me while I’m trying to relax. If you
      work intensely every day, you’ll find that the work doesn’t
      follow you home. Not only are you deliberately stopping yourself
      from working after-hours, but your mind will
      actually <span class="emph">allow</span> you to stop working after-hours. </p>
<p id="N10D9B"> Budget your work hours carefully. Work less, and you’ll
      accomplish more. Work is always more welcome when you’ve
      given yourself time away from it. </p>
<h3>Act on It!</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p id="N10DA4">
         Make sure you sleep well tonight.  Tomorrow, eat breakfast and then start work at an exact time (preferably a little earlier than usual). Work intensely for four hours. Take an hour lunch. Then work for four more hours so intensely that you are absolutely exhausted and can’t do any more. Go home, relax, and have fun.
