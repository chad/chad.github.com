<p id="N10510"> While managing an application development group, I once asked one of my employees, “What do you want to do
      with your career? What do you want to be?” I was terribly disappointed by his answer: “I want to be a
      J2EE architect.” I asked why not a “Microsoft Word designer” or a “RealPlayer
      installer?” </p>
<p id="N10513"> This guy wanted to build his <span class="emph">career</span> around a specific technology created by a specific company of
      which he <span class="emph">was not an employee</span>. What if the company goes out of business? What if it let its now-sexy
      technology become obsolete? Why would you want to trust a technology company with your career? </p>
<p id="N1051C"> Somehow, as an industry, we fool ourselves into thinking <span class="emph">market leader</span> is the same thing as
        <span class="emph">standard</span>. So, to some people, it seems rational to make another company’s product part of their
      identities. Even worse, some base their careers around non-market-leading products—at least until their careers
      fail so miserably that they have no choice but to rethink this losing strategy. </p>
<p id="N10525"> Let’s take a moment again to remember that we should think of our career as a business. Though it’s possible to
      build a business that exists as a parasite of another (such as companies who build spyware removal products to
      make up for inadequacies in Microsoft’s browser security model), as an individual it’s an incredibly risky thing
      to do. A company, such as the spyware example I just mentioned, can usually react to changing forces in the market
      such as an unexpected improvement in Microsoft’s browser security (or Microsoft deciding to enter the spyware
      removal market), whereas an individual doesn’t have the bandwidth or the surplus cash to suddenly change career
      direction or focus. </p>
<p id="N1052C"> The sad thing about a vendor-centric view of the world is that, usually, the details of a vendor’s software
      implementation are a secret. You can really learn only so much about a piece of proprietary software until you
      reach the <span class="emph">professional services barrier</span>. The professional services barrier is the artificial barrier
      that a company erects between you and the solution to a problem you may have so that it can profit from selling
      you support services. Sometimes this barrier is intentionally erected, and sometimes it’s erected as a side effect
      of the attempt the company makes to protect its intellectual property (by not sharing its source code). </p>
<p id="N10535"> So, although a single-minded investment in one particular technology is almost always a <span class="emph">bad idea</span>,
      if you <span class="emph">must</span> do so, consider focusing on an open source option, as opposed to a commercial one. Even
      if you can’t or don’t want to make the case for using the open source solution in your workplace, use the open
      source option as the platform from which you can take a deep dive into a technology. For example, you may want to
      become an expert in how J2EE application servers work. Instead of focusing your efforts on the details of how to
      configure and deploy a commercial application server (after all, <span class="emph">anybody</span> can figure out how to tweak
      settings in a config file, right?), download the open source JBoss or Geronimo servers, and set aside time for
      yourself to not only learn how to operate the servers but to study their internals. </p>
<p id="N10541"> Before long, you’ll realize you’re naturally changing your view. This J2EE thing (or whatever you chose to get
      into) really isn’t all that special. Now that you see the details of the implementation, you see that there are
      high-level conceptual patterns at work. And, you start to realize that, whether with Java or some other language
      or platform, distributed enterprise architecture is distributed enterprise architecture. Your view changes from
      narrow to wide, and your mind starts to open. You start to realize that these concepts and patterns that your
      brain is sorting through and making sense of are much more scalable and universal than any specific vendor’s
      technology. “Let the vendors come and go—I know how to design a system!” </p>
<h3>Act on It!</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p id="N1054A"> Try a small project, twice. Try it once in your home base technology and then once, as idiomatically as
            possible, in a competing technology.</p>
</li>
</ol>
