I have spoken to companies, groups and conferences all over the world.  I love to share what I've learned.  I can happily speak about software development practices, managing software teams, life in general, career development, creativity, health, the process of learning, and Ruby or Rails.

"Contact me":/pages/contact if you'd like to inquire about me speaking at your event.

Below are links to a few talks I've given over the years:
