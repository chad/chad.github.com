This week's Passionate Programmer excerpt is a warning against placing too strong a bet on technology you don't control. It's funny how dated it sounds. Case in point, I guess.

As a side note, it was in <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com">Dave Thomas's</a> original edits for the book in 2005 that, through his pull-quote "Vendor-centric views are typically myopic", I learned the word "myopic". I've learned two other words from Dave in my life: "anodyne" and "octothorpe". Thanks, Dave!
