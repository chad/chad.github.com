A <a
href="http://www.ntecs.de/blog/Blog/HumanUnderstandabilityRuby.rdoc">very
interesting post</a> by Michael Neumann (who also maintains a <a
href="http://www.ntecs.de/old-hp/uu9r/lang/html/lang.en.html">fabulous site
with hundreds of programming language examples</a>), where he walks through
various aspects of the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> programming
language with his (not-a-programmer) girlfriend and asks her to explain
what different pieces of sample code mean.

<p>
She (and Ruby) do remarkably well. Kind of a neat idea.

I&#8217;ve said for years that (in the Java world) at a certain layer of
your application&#8217;s design, an interesting test of its
readability/maintainability is whether or not your (not-a-programmer)
customer(s) can read and understand it. I would hate to see how some of the
projects I&#8217;ve worked on would stand up to such a
test&#8212;especially the Java ones.
