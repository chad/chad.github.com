Starting today I'm going to post a free excerpt from <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> every week (time permitting) until I've posted them all. (Thanks to <a href="http://pragprog.com">my generous publisher</a> for allowing this!)

If you have read it and wished you could share sections with friends and co-workers that don't own the book, now's your chance. If you haven't read it and really don't want to spend money on it, you can read it for free (out of order) over the course of the next year.

I'd love to hear your reactions (via twitter, blog posts, hacker news comments, etc.) to each chapter as I post them. I released the first edition of the book eight years ago, and I always hear bits and pieces of feedback on the book in general. I'm hoping this gives me and the book's readers a chance to focus discussion on each concept.

The first post is one of my favorites and one that gets little attention. It's about "value rigidity" and the human tendency to hold on to things that are important to them so tightly that they can't detect a change in context. I talk about this concept somewhat narrowly in the book, but I constantly see its application in daily life.  For me it's a very useful mirror in which to inspect my behaviors.
