In <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to
India</a>, I stress the importance of writing as a way to build your
personal brand and make yourself more marketable. I specifically suggest
that software developers open a weblog.

<p>
Marketing maverick <a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> just <a
href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/whos_there_the_.html">published
a free ebook</a> called &quot;Who&#8217;s There?&quot; that goes into much
greater depth about the how and why of blogging.
</p>
<p>
Why bother? Seth says:
</p>
<pre>
        If you care about your personal brand and career and impact, you need a
        blog. And you should start the cycle of getting better at blogging.

A favorite quote:
</p>
<pre>
        When you apply for a job, so do a thousand other people.
        When you see a house listing, so do a thousand other people.
        When you bid on a grilled cheese sandwich on eBay, so do a thousand other people.
</pre>
<p>
mmmm.&#8230;grilled cheese.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#8217;ve <a

if you&#8217;re interested. It&#8217;s a short and very worthwhile read.
