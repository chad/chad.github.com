Francis Hwang, one of this year&#8217;s speakers, had the <a
href="http://fhwang.net/blog/81.html">excellent idea</a> to put up a <a
href="http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyConf2005Facebook">Wiki page</a> on
which <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> attendees can add
their names, photos, and a short description of themselves.

<p>
With the conference <em>tripling</em> in size this year, it&#8217;s
actually possible that you won&#8217;t just happen to run into someone
you&#8217;ve been wanting to meet unless you search for them.
</p>
<p>
Go add yourself. It&#8217;s fun.
</p>
<p>
For those of you coming to the conference, seeya next week.
