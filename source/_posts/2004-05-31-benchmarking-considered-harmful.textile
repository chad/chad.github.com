I&#8217;ve recently been reading <a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth
Godin's</a> books, and like all books that I actually finish reading, their
message has crept into my every day thinking. I highly recommend his most
recent, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/dt/assoc/tg/aa/xml/assoc/-/1591840414/permissionmarket/ref%3Dac%5Fbb6%5F%2C%5Famazon/102-0400087-9791323">Free
Prize Inside</a>.

<p>
Seth also has a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com">weblog</a> which
offers a non-stop, up-to-the-minute continuation of the material in his
books. Today, he made his <a
href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/05/the_curse_of_gr.html">best
weblog entry yet</a>. He specifically takes aim in this post at the act of
benchmarking, but more generally at the outdated idea of linear innovation.
While he doesn&#8217;t specifically say so in this post, the ideas from
this post, Free Prize Inside, and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/159184021X/qid=1086035550/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-0400087-9791323?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Purple
Cow</a> are directly applicable in (probably any field, but specifically)
the computer industry.

Once you know what &quot;Purple Cow&quot; means, I&#8217;d be interested to
hear what people think of as being recent technological Purple Cows (not
from a business perspective). I&#8217;ve written about this as it relates
to programming language evolution (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/LanguageEvolution.html,v">LanguageEvolution</a>
&#8212; mostly regurgitating the thoughts of other smarter people :). A
more concrete, actually implemented example would be <a
href="http://www.beta4.com/seaside2/">Seaside</a>. Any recent others of
note?
