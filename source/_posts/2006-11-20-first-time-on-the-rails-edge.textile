This past weekend, I had the privilege of participating in Pragmatic
Studio&#8217;s <a href="http://therailsedge.com">Rails Edge</a> conference.
I haven&#8217;t had this much fun in a <em>long</em> time. It was a
single-track event with a definite who&#8217;s-who <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/speakers.html">speaker
lineup</a> (seriously humbling to be in that list). I learned an incredible
amount from the other speakers&#8217; presentations (not to mention my own,
come to think of it).

<p>
Highlights for me were getting to pick <a
href="http://duncandavidson.com/">James's</a> brain about how best to deal
with multiplatform issues in <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a>,
learning about Rails internals from <a href="http://vernix.org">Marcel
Molina, Jr.</a> (I don&#8217;t think a presentation went by for the full 3
days without Marcel being asked some hard questions), and spending quality
time with the <a href="http://relevancellc.com/">Relevance</a> guys for the
first time.

(Like many of the best photos of Ruby/Rails events, <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com">Dave Thomas</a> took this photo.
Check out his <a

of the event. Lots of good ones.)
</p>
<p>
Overall, this is the event that I think is responsible for fully
rejuvenating me after a short period of burnout. I can feel the wheels
turning again and can&#8217;t <em>wait</em> until the <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/reston.html">next one</a> in
Reston. Being their home town, maybe some of the <a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">folks</a> <a
href="http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/">from</a> <a
href="http://infoether.com/">InfoEther</a> will make it.
</p>
<p>
The conversations on RubyGems and deployment issues spawned a <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/tattle">new project</a> which
we&#8217;re banging away at. Hopefully we&#8217;ll have a release over the
holidays (in between driving, eating too much turkey, etc.)
