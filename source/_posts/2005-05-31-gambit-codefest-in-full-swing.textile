Not to be outdone by the Seattle.rb crew, Greg and James are <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ruby_gambit/">broadcasting their
progress</a> on their <a
href="http://ruby-lang.org/en/20050311.html">RubyCentral CodeFest
grant</a>.

<p>
It&#8217;s fun to watch an ongoing, quickly moving project like this. As
Tom Copeland mentioned on <a href="http://ruby-talk.org">ruby-talk</a>, you
can see the CVS age sticking around in minutes (and not hours or days).

When it&#8217;s finished, Gambit looks like it&#8217;s going to be
something fun to play with:
</p>
<pre>
        Gambit is pure Ruby framework for building multiplayer Web games
        offering two key services:  Game management and design tools.  Gambit
        can manage player's accounts, game hosting and joining, player
        histories, in-game communication systems and out-of-game notifications
        for in-game activities.

<p>
It&#8217;s nice to see these RubyCentral CodeFests starting to happen.
