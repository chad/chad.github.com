Earlier this week, "Daniel Steinberg":http://dimsumthinking.com interviewed me for the "Pragmatic Programmers' Podcast":http://pragprog.com/podcasts. I'm a fan of Daniel's podcasts, so it was cool to have an opportunity to be the other voice on one of them.

What was also fun about this one was that when he asked to interview me, he didn't have a specific topic in mind. So it ended up being about nothing and everything. Kinda like Seinfeld but unfortunately not as funny.

Since I haven't been posting here a lot lately, the podcast is a good place to find out what I'm up to, which includes "Arduino":http://arduino.cc hacking and writing a computer game which interfaces with my exercise bike.
