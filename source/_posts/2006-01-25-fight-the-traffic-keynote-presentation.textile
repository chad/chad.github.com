Last week I flew to Montreal to keynote at <a
href="http://cusec.soen.info/">CUSEC</a>. Mine was the opening keynote,
titled <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/FightTheTraffic.rdoc,v">Fight
The Traffic</a>. Other keynotes were to include <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> and <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.
Unfortunately David ended up getting snowed in, so I also gave the closing
keynote, which I called &quot;Rails is Boring, and Ruby is a Toy&quot;, and
in which I described some of the salient philosophical features of Ruby and
Rails and encouraged their application in other (less fortunate?) software
environments.

<p>
CUSEC is a wonderful conference. It&#8217;s arranged by Canadian software
engineering students <em>for</em> software engineering students. The talks
were engaging, and like most conferences, the in-between-session
discussions were especially inspirational. The CUSEC organizers wooed me
with the promise of speaking to the future of software development in
Canada, and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. These were some smart,
<em>passionate</em> kids.

It was my first chance to see Kathy&#8217;s <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7077">Creating
Passionate Users</a> talk, which I can&#8217;t recommend more strongly. It
will affect the way <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">I write</a>, work,
and <em>consume</em> from now on. She&#8217;s got a book coming out in the
not-too-distant future on the topic. I&#8217;m convinced that it will
become and remain a classic.
</p>
<p>
I was particularly fond of my slides for the talk. I can say that without
fear of sounding conceited, because I didn&#8217;t make them myself. My
friend and cothinker, <a href="http://steveakers.blogspot.com/">Steve
Akers</a> worked with me to <em>draw</em> the slides for my talk by
<em>hand</em>. What follows is the title slide, but the rest are available
on his site, <a href="http://www.moebot.com">Moe Bot</a>. Check &#8216;em
out. You can also <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MoeBot">subscribe to

The sessions were recorded, so I&#8217;ll post a link when they&#8217;re
available. On the mp3, you&#8217;ll be able to hear me make wretched noises
on my soprano saxophone. Stay tuned. You won&#8217;t want to miss that.
