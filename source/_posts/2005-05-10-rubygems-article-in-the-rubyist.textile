Our kind friends at <a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/magazine/">The
Rubyist</a> released their latest edition today. Though I don&#8217;t read
Japanese, I&#8217;m always sure to find pointers to interesting Rubyisms
via The Rubyist.

<p>
This time, they&#8217;ve featured <a
href="http://jp.rubyist.net/magazine/?0006-PackageManagement">the first</a>
in a multipart article series I&#8217;m writing on <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>. Big thanks to <a
href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/babie/">babie</a> for translating!

It&#8217;s really cool to see your own words in a language you
(embarrassingly, when you have Japanese heritage, I have to admit)
can&#8217;t even read.

<p>
For those English speakers who aren&#8217;t as easily amused as I am,
I&#8217;ve also posted the article <a
href="http://rubygarden.org/index.cgi/Libraries/RubyGems-PastPresentAndFuture-part1.rdoc">in
English</a> over on <a href="http://www.rubygarden.org">RubyGarden</a>.
