We're at "Ruby Kaigi 2008":http://jp.rubyist.net/RubyKaigi2008/ and having a great time.  Yesterday "Rich":http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ and I did a panel discussion with "Masayoshi Takahashi":http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html and "Matz":http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/ on the history of Ruby communities and business outside of Japan.

Today the main conference starts with presentations by Koichi, Charlie, and Evan on YARV, JRuby, and Rubinius respectively.  It's shaping up to be an excellent conference.  More later.

The one thing that strikes me so far is that it's much easier to get here and participate than I thought it would be.  If you've considered coming to Ruby Kaigi and have never been to Japan, I highly recommend it.  Tokyo is easy to get around even without speaking Japanese and the trip wasn't as harrowing as I expected.  Hopefully next year we'll see the non-Japanese contingent grow and the language barriers blur a little more.
