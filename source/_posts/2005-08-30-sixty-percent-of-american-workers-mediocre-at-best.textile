According to Randstad, only <a
href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/24/pf/workplace_morale/index.htm?section=money_pf">40
percent of employees feel that morale is good at their workplace</a>.

<p>
Think about the last time you were in a bad morale situation at work (for
60% percent of you, that&#8217;s right now). How good was your performance?
How good a job do you do when you&#8217;re not happy with what you&#8217;re
doing or who you&#8217;re doing it for?
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll answer for you. You do a mediocre job at best. Most likely, you
do a poor job.
</p>
<p>
If I want someone to do a mediocre job, I&#8217;m going to look for the
cheapest available option. In programming terms, that means low hourly
rate. In today&#8217;s environment, low hourly rate means India, China, the
Phillipines or some other &quot;low cost country&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Is our morale low because we&#8217;re being squeezed for more work at lower
wages and because we&#8217;re constantly facing the threat of being
offshored? Or are we constantly facing the threat of being offshored
<em>because</em> our morale is low, and we are doing, collectively, a
mediocre job?
