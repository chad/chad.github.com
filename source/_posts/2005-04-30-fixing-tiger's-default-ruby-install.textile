The Ruby that ships with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is pleasantly current but
has an issue that prevents C extensions from compiling and installing
properly. In case you&#8217;ve just upgraded and want to use the
Apple-supplied Ruby, go install <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a> (as if you haven&#8217;t
already!) and do:

<pre>
        sudo gem install fixrbconfig
        sudo fixrbconfig
</pre>
<p>
This will fix some settings in rbconfig.rb that you probably don&#8217;t
care to fix by hand.
