<a href="http://www.toolshed.com">Andy Hunt</a> of the <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Pragmatic Programmers</a> has
started <a
href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/articles/2005/08/24/new-podcasts">podcasting</a>.
Much to my delight, he chose to record an excerpt from the introduction to
<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to
India</a> (MJWTI). It&#8217;s the very beginning of the book which tells
the story of my first experiences in India (My job <em>did</em> go to
India. I went with it).

<p>
Listening to my own words read by someone else (and really well, I might
add) is <em>bizarre</em>. I think the book might actually be better this
way. I could also smell the idlis and sambar (maybe I&#8217;m just hungry).

<a href="http://www.toolshed.com/downloads/podcasts/MJWTIIntro.mp3">Give it
a listen</a> (or better, <a
href="http://www.toolshed.com/podcasts/index.xml">subscribe</a> to
Andy&#8217;s feed) and let us know what you think.
