We (<a href="http://rubycentral.org">RubyCentral</a>) are <a
href="http://ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/125566">giving
away</a> FREE MONEY to Rubyists who have a good idea for a piece of
software and want to get together with like-minded Rubyists to see the idea
through.

<p>
The core of <a href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a> was
created over a weekend, accelerated by the fact that several of us were
programming together. <a href="http://dnssd.rubyforge.org">Ruby DNSSD</a>
and Ruby&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ruby/lib/scanf.rb">scanf</a>
were created during similar gatherings.
</p>
<p>
So, now we&#8217;re formalizing the previously informal and giving you FREE
MONEY to help make it easier.
</p>
<p>
Are you a Rubyist? Do you have an idea?
</p>
<p>
Well, then shame on you for not applying. Time is running out.
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
If you don&#8217;t have an idea, here are some things on my own personal
wishlist:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby Subversion bindings

</li>
<li>A nice bug tracker in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>

</li>
<li>Something that simplifies the open source ruby library release process,
integrating <a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org">RAA</a>, <a
href="http://rubyforge.org">RubyForge</a>, <a
href="http://ruby-talk.org">ruby-talk</a>, <a
href="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a>, and <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>.

</li>
</ul>
