We at <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org">Ruby Central, Inc.</a> are proud
to present the <a href="http://railsconf.org/">First International Rails
Conference</a>.

<p>
The conference will be held June 22-25, 2006 in Chicago. We&#8217;ll have
keynotes including <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier
Hansson</a> and <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Dave
Thomas</a>. There will be additional keynotes announced later. You
won&#8217;t want to miss it. <a
href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2005/11/24/announcing-railsconf-2006">Head
on over</a> and read the full announcement for the rest of the details we
have now. Be sure to <a

so you don&#8217;t miss anything.
</p>
<p>
We&#8217;ve learned a lot over the past five years doing <a
href="http://www.rubyconf.org">The International Ruby Conference</a>, and
we&#8217;re expecting this conference to represent both the best of what
RubyConf has been as well as an opportunity to try some new and potentially
radical ideas. We&#8217;ve already got some ideas brewing, but we&#8217;d
also like to <a
href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/RailsConfIdeas">hear from
you</a>!
</p>
<p>
(Thanks to <a href="http://conio.net">Sam Stephenson</a> for the beautiful
RailsConf web design!)
