Spur of the moment, we decided to take a vacation. Two days later,
we&#8217;ve got tickets and hotel reservations in Barcelona.

<p>
Busy with work, I haven&#8217;t taken the time to learn <b>anything</b>
about what Spain will be like. I know two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve never been there before.

</li>
<li>A lot of people will probably speak Spanish (though, in Barcelona, the
predominant language seems to be Catalan (<a
href="http://www.june29.com/HLP/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html">www.june29.com/HLP/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html</a>)).

</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Are nested parentheses an intuitive construct for non-programming readers
of English?)
</p>
<p>
I hope the Catalonians won&#8217;t be too offended if we try to speak
Spanish to them. I don&#8217;t think we have time to learn Catalan.
</p>
<p>
So, a week and a half from now, I&#8217;ll be back&#8212;hopefully
refreshed and having risen my once-decent knowledge of basic Spanish from
the dead. If there&#8217;s anything interesting to look at in Spain, I
might even post a picture or two.
</p>
<p>
Hasta la vista.
