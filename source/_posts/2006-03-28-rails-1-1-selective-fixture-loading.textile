Rails 1.1 introduces greater than <a
href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/03/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things">500
enhancements and fixes</a>. Here&#8217;s one of the more obscure ones that
you may not hear about otherwise. I was able to slip a trivial (one line)
patch in just under the wire for Rails 1.1 before it went out yesterday.
Now you can do this:

<pre>
  rake db:fixtures:load FIXTURES=people
</pre>
<p>
or multiple:
</p>
<pre>
  rake db:fixtures:load FIXTURES=people,surveys
</pre>
<p>
Not a big deal for the average Rails developer, but when you&#8217;ve got
150+ models and 6.5MB of fixtures like <a href="http://naviance.com">we
do</a> it makes a big difference.
