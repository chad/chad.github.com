I am one of the original organizers of both <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> and <a href="http://railsconf.com">RailsConf</a>.  Combined, I've organized or been on the program committee for around 25 conferences.  I've read hundreds of proposals and seen hundreds of conference talks.

Occasionally, a proposal or a talk stands out. Here's one that I still think of when new would-be speakers ask how to get their first talk accepted. When preparing for RailsConf 2010 in Baltimore, we received this email from <a href="https://twitter.com/r00k">Ben Orenstein</a>:

Ben had never spoken at a conference before, and he knew we had a lot of proposals to consider.  Here's what I like about his email (and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg33EQCdMxw">video</a>):
<ul>
<li>Most important, he showed us how enthustiastic he to give the talk. Enthusiasm is one of the most sorely lacking features of technical conference talks. When someone is excited, I am more engaged.</li>
<li>He reassured us that, though we might not have heard of him before, he was qualified to give the subject a good treatment.</li>
<li>He told us he was going to be prepared when the conference rolled around. It's rare that a conference presenter explicitly says "I am going to be ready".</li>
<li>He went to the trouble to make a video which showed us both what his style might be like in person and again that he really wanted this opportunity to speak.</li>
</ul>
I immediately looked up his proposal, and as you might guess it was as thoughtful and energetic as the email and video.

I then sent my <a href="http://benscofield.com/">conference co-chair, Ben Scofield</a>, the following email:

<img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s10/sh/c94adab6-544d-42a0-8dc8-8a0204a2f7c4/adf24b4fa91301619dbdd76a0c0bd6d2/deep/0/Screenshot%205/25/13%204:55%20PM.png">

And his response:

This is surely only one way to get a talk accepted, but as a new presenter, it's a good example to consider.

(You can hear a conversation between me and Ben about this proposal and more at the <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast/44">Giant Robots Podcast</a>.)
