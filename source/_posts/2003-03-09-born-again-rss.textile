Austin Ziegler has revived (<a
href="http://ruby-rss.sourceforge.net/">ruby-rss.sourceforge.net/</a>) my
Ruby RSS module from the dead. He&#8217;s rewritten it to use REXML (<a
href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/XML/rexml_stable/">www.germane-software.com/software/XML/rexml_stable/</a>),
which I had actually finished 6 months ago but never uploaded and has also
added support for RSS 0.92 and RSS 2.0. So, if you want to do some really
nice, easy , validating RSS creation or parsing, head over and check
Austin&#8217;s code out. If you have existing code that uses my old module,
it should work with few or no changes. He hasn&#8217;t released the new
version yet, so you&#8217;ll have to get it from CVS. I&#8217;m sure
he&#8217;d love to have some beta testers.

I thought I&#8217;d get around to helping him finish up or maybe even
adding RSS 1.0 support, but so far I haven&#8217;t been able to muster the
gumption. I guess RSS has finally fallen into the category of things
I&#8217;d like to *just work* without any effort on my part. Thanks to
Austin for making it so.
