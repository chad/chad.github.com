<a href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/">Alan Francis</a> is a long time
industry veteran and agile development guru. I met him several years ago
when he was my team&#8217;s coach at Object mentor&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.objectmentor.com/courses/xpImmersion">XP Immersion</a>
(taught by Robert Martin, Ron Jeffries, and Kent Beck).

<p>
More recently, he was one of the early draft reviewers of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">my book</a>. He had
the following <a
href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/2005/09/my_job_went_to_.html">to say
about it</a>:
</p>
<pre>
        The book is, in my head at least, a companion volume to Pragmatic
        Programmer. PragProg gave a list of concrete advice for programmers
        to improve their programming. MJWTI (as the new book is affectionately
        known) gives a list of good concrete advice for programmer to improve
        everything else that makes them employable.
</pre>
<p>
This isn&#8217;t the first comparison between <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to
India</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic
Programmer</a> that I&#8217;ve heard, and I hope it won&#8217;t be the
last. Since reading it in 2000, The Pragmatic Programmer has been on my
short list of books I recommend to every programmer I work with, because
being a programmer and <em>not</em> having read it is a crime. It just has
too much to offer the average programmer <a
href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/2296">to go unread</a>.
</p>
<p>
If MJWTI can help as many people in as profound a way, the investment will
have been well worth it to me.
</p>
<p>
There are now sample chapters <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">available</a>, and
the book can be pre-ordered (the PDF ships <em>now</em>, and the paper copy
ships at the end of this month). I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts as
you read it (even just the sample chapters). <a
