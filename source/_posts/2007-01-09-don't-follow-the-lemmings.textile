Back in November, I did a presentation for the "XP West Michigan":http://xpwestmichigan.org/ at the "Atomic Object":http://atomicobject.com office in Grand Rapids.  They've recently posted the talk to "Google Video":http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8984753198261505541.

The talk was titled "Don't Follow the Lemmings" and is a continuation of the thoughts laid out in my book, "My Job Went to India":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti.

It being on Google Video, you can watch it online (embedded here, in fact) or download it to your computer or iPod for off-line viewing (a discovery I've recently made which makes plane trips much more enjoyable).

Watching on an iPod should be fine, because there are no slides to squint at.
