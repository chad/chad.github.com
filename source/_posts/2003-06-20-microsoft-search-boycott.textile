Apparently, Microsoft is brewing up their own new search engine technology,
which has got some people thinking they&#8217;re about to try to
Netscape-ize Google (<a

I don&#8217;t really buy into the idea that any company is evil (<a

but I still like this idea: <a

<p>
The idea is that, if enough people setup their robots.txt to disallow
Microsoft&#8217;s bot, it will create holes in MS&#8217;s relevance
ranking, rendering the search engine ineffective. I don&#8217;t want to
ruin Microsoft. But, it would be extremely interesting if a simple,
distributed idea like this actually had an effect on a seemingly inevitable
outcome.

So, what are you waiting for? Join in! The numbers are small now.

<p>
The disadvantage here is that when Microsoft <b>does</b> kill the
competition, your site won&#8217;t be indexed. I think can live with that
for at least as long as it takes to `rm robots.txt` and get crawled.
