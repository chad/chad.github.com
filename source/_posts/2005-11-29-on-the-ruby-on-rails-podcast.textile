<a href="http://topfunky.com/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> recently <a
href="http://hoodwinkd.hobix.com/">hoodwink'd</a> me into doing an
interview for the <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails
Podcast</a>. Geoffrey had a lot of great questions. <a
href="http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2005/Chad-Fowler.mp3">Tune in</a>
to hear me talk about how to become a remarkable software developer, why
Rails developers are currently at risk, why RubyGems has taken so long to
beincluded in the core Ruby distribution, and why you should always strive
to be the worst developer on every team you&#8217;re in.

<p>
Also, if you missed my radio appearance last week, you can now listen to it
<a href="http://www.ourmedia.org/node/105087">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m still trying to get used to the sound of my own voice being
played back to me.
