Congratulations, <a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Random/JoltAward.rdoc">Dave</a>, and
<a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/News/Jolt2004.html,v">Andy</a>. Nice
to see someone make a courageous move and have it pay off.

<p>
If you haven&#8217;t read these books yet (and you&#8217;re a software
developer), you really should do yourself a favor and make the time.
Don&#8217;t let &quot;Starter&quot; in the title fool you. Sure, the books
are about fundamental and could be used as a &quot;starter kit&quot; (as
the name suggests). But, greatness is (almost always) built on strong
fundamentals, and you&#8217;re never too good to need more practice.
