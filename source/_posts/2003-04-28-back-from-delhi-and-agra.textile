We just finished our last trip up North before we pack up and go home to Louisville.  We flew with Walter and Mary Ellen to
Delhi, and then drove to Agra to see the Taj Mahal.  The first day in Agra, the Taj was closed.  So, we decided to
take a walk through the neighborhoods surrounding the monument.  We made a lot of new friends.
