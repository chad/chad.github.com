It seems like a long way away, but "The Rails Edge":http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/ is coming to Chicago on August 23-25.

The Rails Edge content continually changes, which makes this a favorite for speakers as well as attendees.  Looking at the fresh lineup of talks, this is going to be the best one yet.  When you get a group like this together:

"Dave Thomas":http://pragmagmaticprogrammer.com

"Mike Clark":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom

"Justin Gehtland":http://relevancellc.com

"Stuart Halloway":http://relevancellc.com

"Marcel Molina Jr.":http://project.ioni.st

"Jim Weirich":http://onestepback.org

"Ezra Zygmuntowicz":http://brainspl.at/

"me":http://chadfowler.com ;)

...it's bound to be both education _and_ entertaining.

Anyway, the early bird registration ends July 1.  People tend to get distracted during the summer and miss this kind of thing.  "Here's registration":http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/register.html if you're interested.

Seeya there!
