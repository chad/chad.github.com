Rob, over at <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com">BusinessPundit</a>, <a
href="http://www.businesspundit.com/archives/002301.html">made a
confession</a> last night about not being good at self-promotion. <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/WhyDoGeeksHateMarketing.rdoc,v">It's
not just us geeks</a> who are uncomfortable promoting ourselves.
Here&#8217;s a guy who has been living and breathing entrepreneurialism for
several years and who writes about it <em>daily</em>.

<p>
He closes with a paragraph that could have been lifted directly out of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">MJWTI</a>:
</p>
<pre>
  What is it like where you work? Does your company reward the best employees,
  or the best at self-promotion? Is Donald Trump really a good businessman,
  or just a good self-promoter? Is there even a difference between the two?
</pre>
<p>
I&#8217;d say that, as an entrepreneur, the answer is (at least in part)
&quot;no&quot;. If you can&#8217;t promote it, (in most cases) you
can&#8217;t sell it. And if it doesn&#8217;t sell, it&#8217;s not valuable.
