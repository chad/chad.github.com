Tonight, <a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> and I are headed
off to Chicago. I&#8217;ll be attending 37 Signals&#8217; <a
href="http://www.37signals.com/workshop-basecamp.php">"Building of
Basecamp"</a> workshop on Friday. On Saturday, there is a <a
href="http://ruby.meetup.com/55/events/4500623/">Ruby meet</a> at
Giordano&#8217;s pizza downtown (and then moving to a conference room at a
company somewhere) at noon.

<p>
It looks like the event is at maximum capacity, whatever that means, but I
bet if you haven&#8217;t gotten your name on the list you could probably
still muscle your way in for some pizza and some chatting.
</p>
<p>
There will be an exciting cast of characters present, including the elusive
<a href="http://blog.curthibbs.us/">Curt Hibbs</a>, Python insurgent <a
href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/">Ian Bicking</a>, Ajax master <a
href="http://conio.net/">Sam Stephenson</a>, and of course our <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com">friend from Denmark</a>.
</p>
<p>
Should be a hoot.
