According to a new survey by the <a href="http://www.simnet.org/">Society
for Information Management</a>, <em>business</em> leaders in IT want
employees who have <em>business</em> skills. Shocking, I know.

<pre>
        &quot;These weren't interviews with business managers or HR, these were the
        CIOs themselves, and so it's very interesting that they are putting
        such a high value on skills to help their business rather than just
        hiring the most technical person they can find&quot;, Kaiser said.

<p>
Very interesting? What is the purpose of an employee if not to help the
business that employs them?
