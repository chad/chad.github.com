Daniel Berger just released <a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/pathname2/">pathname2</a>, a file
path manipulation library that works well on UNIX or Windows systems
(including UNC paths).

<p>
Most notable about this from my perspective is that it is 299th unique <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGem</a>. That means there are 299
different pieces of software (not counting their many different versions)
available for installation via the RubyGems system.
</p>
<pre>
        ~/svn/MJWTI/Book chadfowler$ gem list -r|grep &quot;^[a-zA-Z].*)$&quot;|wc -l
        299
        ~/svn/MJWTI/Book chadfowler$
</pre>
<p>
As of this week, not counting downloads of the <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/">Ruby Windows
Installer</a>, the RubyGems framework has been downloaded more than 50,000
times. Within a week, it will have served up <a
href="http://gems.rubyforge.org/stats.html">half a million gems</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, who&#8217;s going to create the 300th gem?
</p>
<p>
Be sure to watch the <a href="http://onestepback.org/gemwatch.rss">rss
feed</a> if you want to find out which gem pulled across the 300 mark.
