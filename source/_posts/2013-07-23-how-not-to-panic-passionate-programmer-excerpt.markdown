<a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2013/07/16/passionate-programmer-a-free-excerpt-almost-every-week/">As I mentioned last week,</a> I'm releasing chapters of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> every(ish) week until they've all been posted.

This week's chapter is one I actually re-read myself sometimes as a reminder. It's about how to stay calm  and focused in the face of stress. It's one of the most important lessons I've learned (and continue to learn) throughout my career and applies to every job I've had. Too often, our reaction to stress is to freak out and _just_ _start_ _trying_ _shit_.

In the chapter, I mention a Doom deathmatch player who went by the name "Noskill".  I learned after the release of the book that Noskill aka Chris Crosby had <a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chris_Crosby_(NoSkill)">died in a car accident at the age of 23</a>. As weird as it is, I hope Chris's family discovers that he somehow influenced my career and appeared in a book for software developers, perhaps some of whom will go on to work on the games he loved so much.

Anyway, here it is.  <a href="http://chadfowler.com/passionate-programmer/panic.html">Don't Panic</a>.
