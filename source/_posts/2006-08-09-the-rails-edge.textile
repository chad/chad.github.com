Today <a href="http://clarkware.com">Mike and Nicole Clark</a> let their <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/cgi-bin/pragstudio.cgi/AnnouncingTheRailsEdge.rdoc">next
big thing</a> out of the bag: <a href="http://therailsedge.com">The Rails

gushing</a> over the single-track, collaborative format. This thing&#8217;s
going to be different.
