Here's an exercise you can put into place right now which will have a lasting, significant, positive effect on your life
and the lives of those you work, live, collaborate, and play with. There are two versions: an easy version and a harder version. Start with the easy
version unless you're the kind of person who has to do things the hard way.

## The easy version
Whenever you have a cynical thought, keep it to yourself. Never utter, write, or otherwise convey it. Put it away. Think it to yourself all day if you have to, but never express it.

## The harder version
Whenever you have a cynical thought, keep it to yourself. Analyze it. Scrutinize it. Prove it to be wrong. Discover the personal fear within you from which it grew, and make a plan to address that fear
fully. Be thankful to the negative emotion for giving you the opportunity to understand your own weaknesses.

Cynicism is born of laziness and fear: It's easy to complain about something. It's harder to fix it. It's both scary and liberating to trust other people to try to be their best.

## Update

As <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">@dhh</a> pointed out on Twitter after I posted this, I worded this more absolutely than intended. I meant this to be an "exercise" (see the first sentence). Skepticism is healthy. Sometimes, cynicism is the right reaction. I believe most of us could use a lot less of it.
