Inspired by a dinner conversation at <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/">The Rails Edge</a>, Bruce
Williams has <a
href="http://codefluency.com/2006/11/29/rubygem-based-rails-plugins">created</a>
a <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6726">Rails patch</a> to
enable Rails to load plugins installed as gems.

<p>
With this patch, you get plugins with the dependency- and
version-management goodness of RubyGems. Here&#8217;s hoping it gets
applied.
</p>
<p>
On a related note, <a href="http://vernix.org">Marcel</a> pointed out last
night that we&#8217;re up to over 1000 unique gems in the main repository.
I wonder if it&#8217;s time to look at some kind of <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rubygems-developers/2006-November/002224.html">namespacing</a>.
