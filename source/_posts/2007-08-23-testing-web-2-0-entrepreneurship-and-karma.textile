As I mentioned previously, Marcel Molina and I are doing a "full day testing workshop for charity":http://www.railsconfeurope.com/cs/railseurope2007/view/e_sess/14736 at RailsConf Europe next month.

"Dr. Nic Williams":http://drnicwilliams.com/ hopes to attend but rather than donate the required minimum $75 directly, he has "chosen to auction off":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/08/23/myconfplan-for-sale/ his "MyConfPlan":http://myconfplan.com web site and to then donate the proceeds as part of his registration for the tutorial.

So now's your chance to kick start your way into Web 2.0 entrepreneurship, help Dr. Nic fulfill his goal of learning more about testing, and develop good karma all in one action.

"You can bid here.":http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=160150359140

It's easy to give money.  It's much harder and more personal to give your time, passion, accomplishments, and creativity.  Dr. Nic is a shining example for the rest of us.  Thanks, Nic!
