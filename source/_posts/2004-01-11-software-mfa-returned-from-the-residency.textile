I&#8217;ve just returned from the <a
href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA">trial</a> of the Software MFA <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/MFASoftware.rdoc">program</a>
that Dick Gabriel (<a href="http://dreamsongs.com">dreamsongs.com</a>) <a
href="http://dreamsongs.com/MFASoftware.html">proposed</a>.

<p>
I&#8217;m exhausted and will say more about this later, but I do want to
say that thanks to Dick Gabriel, Ralph Johnson, and Brian Marick, this
event was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. I can&#8217;t
wait until the program &quot;officially&quot; starts at UIUC. I&#8217;ll be
there.
