I keep learning this lesson over and over again, so I'm writing it here in an effort to never forget again. As a manager, if some task constantly stresses me out or makes me feel uneasy,
it's probably because I'm doing someone else's job.

I don't mean someone's being lazy and I'm picking up their slack. I'm talking about those nagging little annoying things you find yourself doing as infrequently as you can
and do a half-assed job at every time. So you not only stress because they're in the way of your <i>real</i> work but you stress because you suck at them.

Every time I allow myself to notice this feeling--every time I  analyze what's causing it, it's because I should be delegating this work to someone else. Usually, in a
mature organization, it's even obvious <i>who</i> the work should go to.

The beautiful thing about being a manager of people is that your core job includes uncluttering your and everyone else's work days by putting the work, moving tasks to a home  where they can be
lovingly completed.
