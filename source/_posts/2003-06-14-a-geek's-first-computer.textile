I started out with a Commodore 64 myself. I still remember the weird
feeling I had when I ran &quot;Eliza&quot; for the first time. It was
magical and kind of spooky. I may have actually thought I was talking to an

of that program. I guess Eliza wasn&#8217;t nearly as mean as the kids at
school&#8212;nor did it seem to be much less intelligent. :)
