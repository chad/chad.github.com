James Gosling, father of the <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000568.html">Java programming
language</a>, <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146.htm">thinks Ruby
is just for generating web pages</a>.

He&#8217;s wrong of course, but you already knew that.
</p>
<p>
What&#8217;s notable here isn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s wrong and we need to
defend Ruby from his ignorance. What&#8217;s notable is that the
<em>guy</em> who&#8217;s supposed to be carrying Java forward is completely
clueless about the <em>real</em> competition. My guess is that he
completely understands the challenges C# brings. It&#8217;s easy to
understand. It&#8217;s just like Java.

If this is who Sun has driving their language and platform strategy, Java
may not be the conservative choice of programming technology (for long)
that you might believe it to be.

IBM thought PCs were silly in the early 80s. Not a threat. Not where the
market is. Not big. Not scalable.

Oops.
