It's been a long week.  I started it with having 3 wisdom teeth removed.  Since then, I've been "under the influence".  But, the big news is that the <a href="http://www.gomang.org">Drepung Gomang Tour</a> is in town.
<br>
<br>
Kelly and I are now co-directors of the <a href="http://www.gomanginstitute.org">Drepung Gomang Institute</a> (we're reworking the website), so we have been fortunate to have spent the past week in the presence of ten Tibetan monks.  Buddhist or not (in my case not), there's a lot to learn from a serious monastic practitioner.  
<br>
<br>
The big event this week was the construction of a Sand Mandala.  They spend five days creating an intricate piece of art work only to ceremoniously dismantle it at the end.  As Ngawang Gyatso, "Translator/Driver", explained, it's the process of construction that's important--not the end result.  Very much like what I was talking about <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/ValuelessSoftware.html">here</a>.

Here are the monks working on the Mandala:<br>

If you're in Louisville and interested in some really great cultural events, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.gomanginstitute.org">our website</a> for a listing of upcoming events.  The monks will be here through the first week of October.
