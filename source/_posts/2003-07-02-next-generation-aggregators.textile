I think there are a lot of people (including me) who have been thinking of
implementing something like this:

<p>
<a

</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m really looking forward to the day when this bubbles up to the top
of the right person&#8217;s priority list, and enough people start using it
to make it valuable.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m especially interested in the relevance (see <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/LatentSemanticIndexing.rdoc,v">LatentSemanticIndexing</a>)
idea.
</p>
<p>
With the combination of these kinds of shifts and the proliferation of P2P
and wireless technologies, I&#8217;m betting (and hoping) that the way
I&#8217;ll be using the web by the end of 2004 will be very different than
the way I use it now.
