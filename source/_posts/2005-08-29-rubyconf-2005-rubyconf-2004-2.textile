Registration for the <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">Fifth International
Ruby Conference</a> is up to greater than <a
href="http://rubycentral.org/conference/reg/main/stats">two times the
number</a> of the largest conference to-date. And that&#8217;s not counting
the usual last-minute surge in registration before the conference.

<p>
Check out <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/agenda.html">the
agenda</a>, <a
href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/register/">register</a>, and
(if you or your company have the means) consider <a
href="http://www.rubycentral.org/pledge/">sponsoring</a> the conference. <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> is already signed up to sponsor
(thank you!) with a couple more companies lined up.
</p>
<p>
This is a great chance to meet Matz and many of the leaders of the Ruby
community and the software development industry in general.
</p>
<p>
Even if you&#8217;re not speaking, bring your ideas. Some big ideas (and
code) have come out of conferences past. You&#8217;d be surprised what can
be accomplished in between the sessions of a 3-day conference.
