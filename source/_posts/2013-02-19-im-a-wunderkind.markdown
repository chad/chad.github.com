As I mentioned recently, [we've moved to Berlin!](http://chadfowler.com/blog/2013/01/08/moving-to-berlin-and-auf-wiedersehen-to-friends/).  We got to spend a week of down time exploring the city.  We are definitely in love with Berlin so far!

I'm excited today to finally announce that I've joined [6Wunderkinder](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/blog/willkommen-chad) as CTO. In case you don't know them by the company name, 6Wunderkinder are the creators of the extremely popular [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com), which is a cross-platform, simple, and beautiful productivity application.  I'm a user, and as I've told friends and family about my move, I've discovered that many of you are too.

[As I've said previously,](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/02/former-svp-chad-fowler-on-the-state-of.html), I'll miss my LivingSocial team and look forward to watching them from here in Berlin, but I'm extremely excited to get back to hands-on software development with the small, focused, team of brilliant product engineers here at 6Wunderkinder.

For those in the Berlin tech scene, if you happen to see me around at [Sankt Oberholz](http://www.sanktoberholz.de/), please do stop by and say hi :)
