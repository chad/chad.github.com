I saw this while browsing the Merb source code, and despite the bad variable names thought it was pretty nice:

  module Enumerable
    def injecting(s)
      inject(s) do |k, i|
        yield(k, i); k
      end
    end
  end

Use like:

  <pre>['o', 'hai', 'rly', 'srsly'].injecting({}) {|accumulator, value| accumulator[value] = value.size} 
            # => {"srsly"=>5, "o"=>1, "hai"=>3, "rly"=>3}</pre>

Simple pleasures.  I find it increasingly hard to live without things like this, Object#returning, and Symbol#to_proc as I start to use them.  "After all...":http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html
