Avi and I were talking about <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3257728961">this
post</a> &#8212;specifically <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView">James's</a> comment,
which says that Avi should consider including a templating engine in <a
href="http://www.beta4.com/seaside2/">Seaside</a> to avoid making newcomers
feel uncomfortable.

<p>
I had the following to say (&quot;lusers&quot; refers to the Dick Gabriel
saying that Avi quotes in his post):
</p>

(The ultimate in weblogging laziness.)

<p>
The qmail reference might elude some of you. <a
href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/johnson/">Ralph</a> walked us through
qmail&#8217;s code at the <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA">Software
MFA Program</a> in January. qmail does some really unorthodox things with
IO streams, quickly alerting the reader (of the code) to the fact they
aren&#8217;t in Kansas anymore.
</p>
<p>
My <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA/Craft+Elements">"craft element"</a>
remark refers to the possibility that this kind of forced discomfort
(dissonance) may be a trick-of-the-trade that developers can deliberately
take advantage of.
</p>
<p>
From this perspective, throwing templates into Seaside would be something
like Gyorgy Ligeti ending <a

(scroll down and listen to the clip) on a C major triad.
