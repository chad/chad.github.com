The book is very close to being content complete, shortly after which the
reviewing process will start. The requests from reviewers have been
overwhelming, which is further proof that we&#8217;re on to something here.

<p>
By the way, <a

you think this book is a slam against Indians</a>, be sure to actually read
it before jumping to conclusions.
