In December, we went to the city of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India with Kelly's 
mother and sister.  It was an amazing place.  Incredibly different from being 
in South India.  I guess it must be something like the difference for 
foreigners in the USA going from Wisconsin to New Mexico.  Completely 
different cultures, language, and animals (camels!).  
<P>
As we drove there from Agra, I kept looking at the map and noticing how much 
closer we were getting to Pakistan.  I don't know why, but I get more 
interested in visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan every day.  I can't think 
of many good reasons to go there these days, and there plenty of reasons 
<i>not</i> to go.  Still, I can't get over the infatuation.  
<P>
We took a taxi down (I couldn't talk the family into going by camel cart) 
to the main shopping area in Jaipur to feed our collective addition to <i>consumption of goods</i>.  For some reason, no matter where we go in India, 
I'm always drawn toward the back alleys.  From one small, cramped street 
to a smaller and more cramped one until there are no choices to 
turn around and go back.
<P>
Everyone else went into a saree shop, so I took the opportunity to 
start my regular descent into the depths of the Indian shopping streets.  
I didn't get very far when I noticed a saxophone hanging in a window.  
I stopped and asked (in Hindi--no English here) for the price.  It was 
about $10.  Not bad for an alto saxophone, even if it needs some work.  
I decided not to buy it, and walked back to the saree shop to meet up with 
the family.  A minute or two later, a man approached me, inviting me back 
to the small music shop.  I'm thinking "Oh great, now they're going to try 
to bargain with me", which I don't really mind.  The best time for me to 
practice Hindi is when people are annoying me.  The more annoying the person, 
the better.  I lose any inhibitions I might have of making mistakes, and 
just dig right into it.
<P>
It turns out they just wanted me to come back and talk to them.  By the time 
I got back to the shop, the number of people there had grown from 3 to about 
15.  Apparently, they were all members of the <B>Rajasthan Brass Band</B>.  
They proudly showed me the official band photos on the wall, and introduced 
me to the band's conductor.  They insisted that I come in and sit down with 
them for a solo trumpet performance by one of their star players.  He played 
a rousing version of <i>Brazil</i>.
<P>
Before I left, they asked that we all pose for a picture together with me 
awkwardly holding the $10 saxophone.  Kelly took this photo, which they asked 
for us to send to them (we still owe them a copy).
