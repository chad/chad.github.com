Three years ago tomorrow (my memory isn&#8217;t that good&#8212;I happened
to make a web post about it), I finished reading what would turn out to be
one of the most influential books of my computer programming career, The
Pragmatic Programmer, by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas (<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com</a>).
Since then, I&#8217;ve followed their articles, weblogs (see the links on
the right) and like many others have anticipated the release of their next
book.
</p>
<p>
Taking a surprising turn, they have recently announced the formation of
their own publishing entity and have simultaneously released two new books.
Today, my copies of &quot;Pragmatic Unit Testing&quot; and &quot;Pragmatic
Version Control&quot; arrived.
</p>
<p>
They seem to be catering to the future Pragmatic Programmer market with
material of a more introductory nature. So, the material may be a bit on
the basic side. This is why they are calling these books a
&quot;prequel&quot; as opposed to a true follow-up to Pragmatic Programmer.
</p>
<p>
As long as there&#8217;s no mention of Jar Jar (<a

I&#8217;ll be happy. And, you can never hear good advice too many times.
</p>
<p>
While I obviously haven&#8217;t read these books yet, I&#8217;m going to go
out on a limb and pre-recommend them to you in case you don&#8217;t know
anything about them. If they&#8217;re even nearly as good as the first one,
they will take their place in my list of require reading materials for any
new programmer. <a

(Incidentally, 3 years ago today was the day I first downloaded Ruby [<a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>]. This was actually
also a result of reading The Pragmatic Programmer and the
learn-one-language-per-year tip.)
