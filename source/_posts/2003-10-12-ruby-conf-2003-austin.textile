Just occurred to me today that there&#8217;s only about one month left
until the Third International Ruby Conference (<a
href="http://www.rubyconf.org">www.rubyconf.org</a>). Time to finalize
little details like name tags and t-shirts.

<p>
If you&#8217;re interested in programming&#8212;Ruby or not&#8212;this is a
great conference to attend. The first conference (2001) was one of the best
computer geek gatherings I&#8217;ve been to. We had language designers, XP
people, and a bunch of really smart people with a bunch of really good
ideas. You&#8217;re guaranteed to leave the conference with new found
inspiration.

For some idea of what has gone on in the past:

Registration ends on October 24, but if you miss it you can still get
in&#8212;foodless&#8212;by registering late or just showing up.

<p>
See you there?
