As Ted <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2004/06/16#971">points out</a>,
OSCON <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/29/register.html">early
registration</a> is ending on Friday. You can save a fairly decent amount
of money by signing up early.

<p>
Not only that, but if you sign up for <b>Ruby</b> <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/29/track_ruby.html">sessions</a>
early, you also gain &quot;prestige points&quot;, which are redeemable for
the respect and admiration of your peers. :)
