Just a reminder: <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf 2007</a> CFPs are
due on November 2007. If you&#8217;ve got something exciting to talk about
or valuable experience to share, don&#8217;t let the date slip by. This
year we&#8217;re partnering with the conference team at <a
href="http://ora.com">O'Reilly</a>. It&#8217;s going to be even bigger and
better than our debut in 2006. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the
content evolves and matures along with the Rails community and the
framework itself.
