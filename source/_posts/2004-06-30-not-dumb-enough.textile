Lesson learned: Even when you try to <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Languages/GroovyJSR.rdoc,v">dumb
down the syntax of a language</a>, there are some people for whom you <a
href="http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/1572">can't make it dumb enough</a>.

<p>
Which &quot;obscuring lesson&quot; did we learn from C? Was C more
obfuscated than the languages available at the time of its creation?
</p>
<p>
&quot;weird cryptic syntax&quot;? I&#8217;m not a huge Groovy proponent,
but <a
href="http://www.sauria.com/presentations/Groovy%20SeaJUG%202004-03.ppt.pdf.zip">look
here</a> and contrast pages 2 and 7 in this PDF presentation. The Groovy
example is more cryptic than the Java example?
