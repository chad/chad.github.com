As Jim <a
href="http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Ruby/OneMillionServed.red">put
so eloquently</a>,

<pre>
        $ lynx -dump http://gems.rubyforge.org/stats.html \
         | ruby -e 'p ARGF.inject(0) { |s,t| t.split[1].to_i + s }'
        $ 1007130
</pre>
<p>
Also note that there are now 396 unique libraries and applications to
choose from in the repository. 100 new gems in only <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/RyanWinsThePrize.rdoc,v">3
months</a>! Got a new library that you&#8217;ve been planning to polish off
and release? Go ahead and spend your Sunday on it and you might be lucky
number 400.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it&#8217;s not too late to see RubyGems make an appearance in <a
href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/ruby183PreviewTwo.html">Ruby
1.8.3</a>?
