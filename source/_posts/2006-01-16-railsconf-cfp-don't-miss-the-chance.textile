The <a href="http://railsconf.org/talks">RailsConf Call for
Participation</a> is drawing to a close. Two more weeks to get those talk
proposals in. Don&#8217;t miss the chance to speak at the <a
href="http://railsconf.org">First International Rails Conference</a>.
We&#8217;ve got a ton of great proposals, so if your talk is selected,
you&#8217;ll be in good company. We&#8217;ve also got some exciting
announcements lined up in the area of keynotes, so keep your eyes peeled.
