Some people are <a
href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/10/25/41184.aspx">happy</a>,
and some people are <a
href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2006/10/ruby-sucks.html">sad</a>.
But the truth of the matter is, as <a
href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com">Pat</a> mentions in a comment on
Patrick&#8217;s post, Matz and Koichi are still planning to implement
continuations for Ruby 2.0.

<p>
&quot;If it&#8217;s not too hard&quot;, said Matz over breakfast. Koichi
then nodded quickly and nervously, not looking up from the YARV source on
his laptop (which was given higher priority real estate on the table than
his breakfast plate).
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://headius.com/">Charles</a> says he can do them in JRuby. <a
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott</a> told me he had some ideas
on how to do them on .NET. My money&#8217;s on Koichi for making it happen.
