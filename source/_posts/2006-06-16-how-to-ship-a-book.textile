<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a> is
shipping!

<p>
It&#8217;s always satisfying the first time you get to hold a physical copy
of a book you&#8217;ve slaved over. But as a special treat, this time <a
href="http://pragprog.com">Pragmatic Dave</a> has put together a <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/ShippingRecipes.html">slide
show</a> of what it takes to actually ship a book.
</p>
<p>
Particulary impressive is the fact that Dave seems to have cloned himself
to have more hands on deck during the shipping process. I&#8217;ve always
wondered how he manages to accomplish so much given the same number of
hours available as the rest of us.
