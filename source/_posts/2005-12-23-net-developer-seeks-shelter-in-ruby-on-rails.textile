An <a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ruby-rails/2951980">interesting
post</a> came through on the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>
mailing list today.

<pre>
  Hi,
  having read &quot;my job went to india&quot; I decided to quit programming within
  the Microsoft environment and start something different...

  So, is there any RubyOnRails project that in exchange for &quot;reviving&quot; me
  needs a loyal (code) contributor?

  Thanks in advance
  Michael

Welcome, Michael. You&#8217;ve taken the first step: <em>acting</em> on
your <em>own</em> behalf.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s heartening to see this kind of thing happen as a result of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">words I have
written</a>. I&#8217;m not going to definitively say that moving away from
.NET is the right move for Michael. But <em>deciding</em> to control the
course of his career <em>is</em> the right move. He may fear the Offshoring
tide. Or he may have even already been laid off. (Or neither). But sitting
around being scared, shaking your fist at Lou Dobbs&#8217; propaganda on
CNN isn&#8217;t going to get you anywhere. The only way to get anywhere is
to <em>move</em>.
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s what Michael is doing. Good going, Michael!
