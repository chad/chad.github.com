Thanks to [Lynn Wallenstein](http://lynn.io/), I have a new web site design.

I have also used this as a chance to move from my own server (which I've been screwing with for over a decade) to Octopress hosted on Github Pages. I'm glad to be done with that phase of my life.

Anyway, with Octopress I feel like I'm stepping back to the simple, productive environment I had ten years ago with [Rublog](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rublog/).
