h2.  "The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman":http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X (contributing author)

This book features chapter by me about my transformation from obesity to good health and, more important, the mental process that led me to make the change.  The chapter is called "The Harajuku Moment", named after a trip with some friends to Harajuku in Tokyo.

I have a number of friends and acquaintances who have followed the diet advice in this book and lost a significant amount of weight in a short time.

In the early 2000s, <a href="http://twitter.com/kellyjeanne">@kellyjeanne</a> and I moved to India for a year and a half.  Afterward I wrote this book about what the experience taught me about life and career.

h2.  "Programming Ruby":http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby (contributing author)

If any book could be called the Bible for Ruby, this is it.  Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt are responsible for bringing Ruby into popularity outside of Japan, and this book was the catalyst.  Dave has been relentless about keeping the book up to date and improving it through the years.  You can't go wrong buying and reading a book by Dave Thomas.

h2.  "The Ruby Way (1st Edition)":http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Way-Hal-Fulton/dp/0672320835 (contributing author)

I wrote a big chunk of the networking chapter of this book and was a tech reviewer.  I used the money I earned to buy a very old beat up Volvo station wagon.

h2. Professional Apache Tomcat (contributing author)


I wrote a chapter of this book. Never got paid for it by WROX. They sold the title to Wiley when WROX died.  Wiley asked if I wanted to rev my chapter for the next edition. I said no thanks. They sentence-by-sentence rephrased my chapter and released the book with no attribution or credit.
