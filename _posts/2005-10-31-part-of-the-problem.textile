From the <a

taxi driver</a>:

<pre>
        I had this customer that got totally irate with me.  We
        were stuck in traffic and the customer was in a hurry.

        &quot;Why did you go this way?!  You IDIOT!  I'm going to be
        SO LATE&quot;, he fumed.

        I let him say what he had to say, staring forward at
        the cars ahead of us.  Then, I turned around to look at
        him.

        &quot;I'm sorry you are so angry at the traffic.  But by
        hiring me to take you from one place to another, you have
        become part of the traffic.&quot;
