      This is the first in a series of articles, discussing why
      many software rewrite projects end badly and what
      to do to avoid some of the ways I've seen them go astray.

  
You’ve got an existing, successful software product. You’ve hit  
the ceiling on extensibility and maintainability. Your project platform
is  
inflexible, and your application is a software house of cards that  
can’t support another new feature.

<p>
You’ve seen the videos, the weblog posts and the hype, and  
you’ve decided you’re going to re-implement your product in  
Rails (or Java, or .NET, or Erlang, etc.).

</p>
<p>
Beware. This is a longer, harder, more failure-prone path than you
expect.

</p>
<p>
Throughout my career in software development, I’ve been involved in  
Big Rewrite after Big Rewrite. I suspect it’s because I have an  
interest in learning eclectic computer languages, operating systems,
and  
development environments. Not being just-a-Java-guy or
just-a-Windows-guy  
has led to me becoming a serial rewriter. I’ve been on projects to  
replace C, COBOL, PHP, Visual Basic, Perl, PLSQL, VBX (don’t ask!)  
and all manner of architectural atrocities with the latest and
greatest  
technology of the day.

</p>
<p>
In many cases, these Big Rewrite projects have resulted in unhappy  
customers, political battles, missed deadlines, and sometimes complete  
failure to deliver. In <em>all</em> cases, the projects were
considerably  
harder than the projects’ initiators ever thought they would be.

</p>
<p>
This is not a technology problem. It’s not at all Rails-specific, but  
being in the limelight these days, Rails implementations are both very  
likely to happen and very risky right now.

</p>
<h2>
Why So Hard?

</h2>
<p>
So, why, in software rewrites, when you’re traversing exclusively  
<em>familiar</em> territory are the results so often unpredictable and  
negative?

</p>
<p>
For the next week, I’ll post specific reasons I’ve seen things  
go wrong. The following is a list which will eventually be made into
