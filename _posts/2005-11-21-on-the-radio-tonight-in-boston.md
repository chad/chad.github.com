If you’re in the Boston area, tune into WBNW AM 1120 in Boston or  
WPLM AM 1510 in Plymouth at 6PM EST. I’ll be appearing on the show,  
<a href="http://hirefrequencies.com">Hire Frequencies</a>, talking about
<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to  
India</a> and trying not to tell jokes that are too terribly corny.

<p>
If you’re not in the Boston area, you can listen to the show via  
streaming audio (linked from the Hire Frequencies home page) or you
can  
wait and listen to the archived audio later. I’ll post a link.
