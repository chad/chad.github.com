You can try to hide it or dress it up as something more palatable, but  
they’ll sniff it out and they’ll condemn it for what it is:  
Marketing. Geeks hate marketing.

<p>
From <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammers.com/titles/mjwti">My Job
Went  
to India</a>:

</p>
      A lot of software developers---especially the most conceited ones, it
      seems---live with the misconception that their skill should be self-evident
      to any clued-in manager or employer. They are able to comfortably veil this
      lie inside the cloud of a make believe moral ethic: theyre just too humble
      to market their own abilities. Going out of their way to make their abiliities
      known would be brown nosing. And, no self-respecting programmer would
      be caught dead sucking up to The Man.

      This is all just an excuse. Actually, they're afraid.

<p>
You see, it’s <em>comfortable</em> to condemn any kind of  
self-promotional activity. It’s easy. It’s common. It’s  
the way of the flock.

</p>
<p>
Like one of those silly "Question Reality&quot; bumper stickers,  
it’s just conformist behaviour dressed up in such a way that people  
who like to think of themselves as nonconformists can feel good about
it.

</p>
<p>
It’s fear of rejection.

</p>
<p>
But fear of rejection stops us from putting ourselves in situations
where  
we <em>can</em> be rejected. The opposite of rejection is acceptance.
And  
in an economy, acceptance is success.

</p>
<p>
If we want this profession of software development to thrive, we’re  
going to have to hand-hold or beat this mentality out of our people.

</p>
<p>
I promise. It’ll only hurt for a little while.
