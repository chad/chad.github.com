If you want to be _totally_ up-to-the-second in tune with what's happening at RailsConf, our friends at "Twitter":http://twitter.com have set up an excellent "flash-based visualizer":http://twitter.com/flash/railsconf/.  Click it to have it take over your screen.  Sit back, and let the hours pass.  Let it mesmerize you.

In case, for some reason, you have to get up for your computer, you can follow the "railsconf":http://twitter.com/railsconf user on Twitter with your cell phone by texting "following railsconf" to 40404.  

If you add railsconf as a friend, railsconf will add you as a friend.  This is the New Rails Community:  We friend you back.
