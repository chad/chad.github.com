Francis Hwang, one of this year’s speakers, had the <a
href="http://fhwang.net/blog/81.html">excellent idea</a> to put up a <a
href="http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyConf2005Facebook">Wiki page</a>
on  
which <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> attendees can add  
their names, photos, and a short description of themselves.

<p>
With the conference <em>tripling</em> in size this year, it’s  
actually possible that you won’t just happen to run into someone  
you’ve been wanting to meet unless you search for them.

</p>
<p>
Go add yourself. It’s fun.

</p>
<p>
For those of you coming to the conference, seeya next week.
