Next month, I'll be presenting at "Ruby Nation":http://rubynation.org in my home away from home, Northern Virginia (I seem to spend almost as much time there as I do in Colorado).  The presentation will be something like this:

h2. The Passionate Programmer

What should the career path of a programmer be? How do you know what you're aiming for? What defines success?

Many of us started out assuming the answers to these questions included slowly climbing a corporate promotion structure,
ultimately becoming a people or project manager and no longer a programmer.  

But we didn't get into software development so we could fill out spreadsheets and attend status meetings. We got into software
development because we were excited about it. We wanted to be creative and to build great things. 

From the author of The Passionate Programmer, this session will walk through how a software developer can not only succeed but
work toward building a remarkable career. We'll draw examples from business, the arts, music, and sports. By the end of the
presentation, we will have laid out a structured framework for radically succeeding in the software industry.
