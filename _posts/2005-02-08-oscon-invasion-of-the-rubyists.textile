O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">7th annual Open Source
Convention</a> will be happening on Aug. 1-5 in beautiful Portland, Oregon.

<p>
This year, <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">we're</a> staging a hostile
takeover. If you want to join in on the action, <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/create/e_sess">go
signup</a> for a talk (or two).
</p>
<p>
If you don&#8217;t do Ruby, you&#8217;re still allowed to submit a
proposal. But, everyone interesting will be in the Ruby track this year.

<em>Update</em>: I forgot to mention that you only have until
<em>Sunday</em> to get your proposals submitted! <em>Sunday</em>.
Don&#8217;t procrastinate.
