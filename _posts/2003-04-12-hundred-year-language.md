I just finished reading Paul Graham’s fascinating essay, "The  
Hundred-Year Language&quot; (<a
href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html</a>).  
Having recently spent some time on this topic myself, it was really  
interesting to read his views on the evolution of programming languages
and  
the direction that he thinks things will move in the next century.

<p>
In my recent post on <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/LanguageEvolution.html,v">LanguageEvolution</a>,  
I mentioned that (spoken/written) language evolution is influenced by  
social factors. Language features suggesting affluence often win the  
evolutionary fight as speakers strive to sound more "cultured&quot; or  
intelligent. Paul Graham has the following to say about programming  
language research:

</p>
       Research imposes constraining caste restrictions. In any academic field
       there are topics that are ok to work on and others that aren't.
       Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable and forbidden topics
       is usually based on how intellectual the work sounds when described
       in research papers, rather than how important it is for
       getting good results.

<p>
So, social factors seem to be affecting language designers as well. If
it  
doesn’t show "intellectual affluence&quot;, it’s  
apparently (according to Graham) not likely to show up in research. In
this  
same section, Graham says that he is excited that many new languages
are  
being created by "hackers&quot; these days (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.)  
and that there are some innovative ideas coming out of these languages.
In  
the context of computing history, this represents a step toward
empowerment  
on a wider scale. Not quite "the masses&quot;, but closer.

<p>
If you’re at all interested in this kind of thing, the full article  
is definitely worth a read.
