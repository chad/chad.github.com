<a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a>, on the weblog for his
new  
book, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1591841003/002-2313251-5595221">All  
Marketers Are Liars</a>, tells a <a
href="http://blog.sethgodin.silkblogs.com/Do-you-have-a-Home-Depot-problem.4222.entry">story</a>  
that is heavily relevant to software developers today. He talks about
how  
Home Depot, having conquered the mom and pop hardware shops, has been  
struggling to grow.

<p>
The problem, says Seth, is that Home Depot continues to sell a story
that  
appeals to only a specific worldview: that of Home Depot geeks.

</p>
            Many people, though, see nothing but dread here. They see a store
            with no helpful salespeople, a jumble of product, none just quite
            right, a very very long checkout line and fear.

<p>
Home Depot, with its tall, garage-like appearance, and its endless piles
of  
screws and bolts—all alike, is a nightmarish place for someone like  
me. To confirm Seth’s assertion, when I’m looking for a light  
bulb, there’s no way in <em>hell</em> I’m going to go to a Home  
Depot for it. I only go there when I absolutely have to.

</p>
<p>
So how is this relevant for software developers? If you are a software  
developer, think about this concept of customer "worldview&quot; and  
how it applies to you and your career. Which worldview are you  
<em>really</em> selling your story for?

</p>
<p>
For most of us, it’s the worldview of a fellow software developer.  
But, software developers aren’t the ones that need our services.  
<em>Scared</em> business people do. It’s the Home Depot problem! We  
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">lose
our  
jobs to offshoring</a> or experience salary deflation, and we blame
the  
<em>customers</em>. How can they send <em>our</em> jobs overseas? Why  
don’t they <em>understand</em> what we’re worth?

</p>
<p>
Perhaps they don’t understand, because you’re telling them a  
story that was meant for other <em>programmers</em> to hear. It may even
be  
a story, as is the case with me and Home Depot, that is
<em>scaring</em>  
them. This one may have "worked&quot; for years, but you see where  
it’s getting us now. And, as Seth says, yelling the same story louder  
isn’t going to make it stick.

</p>
<p>
In fact, it’s probably just going to get annoying.
