I guess it’s been a couple of years now since Dave (<a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave">pragprog.com/pragdave</a>) and I had
a  
discussion about attempting to extend some of the benefits of paired  
programming (<a
href="http://www.pairprogramming.com">www.pairprogramming.com</a>) to  
individual programming sessions. Unfortunately, this 5 minute-ish  
conversation resulted in little more than a dangling Wiki link (<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?MorePragmaticTips">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?MorePragmaticTips</a>)  
with a catchy tag line. I’ve revisited it occasionally to see if  
anyone had anything interesting to say.

In his latest Code Kata installment (<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataSeven.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataSeven.rdoc,v</a>),  
Dave has—probably unintentionally—started filling in the hole.  
He suggests a structured, 3-step approach to reviewing your own code,
with  
the goal of developing new perspectives in the process. It’s this  
same role-playing-ish type of process that I’ve had in mind since we  
discussed the "solo pairing&quot; idea.

The Zen Buddhists \[oh no…there he goes with that Buddhism thing  
again\] have developed a concept called "Beginner’s Mind&quot;.

      &quot;In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the
       expert's there are few.&quot;

<p>
As per my limited understanding, the goal is to always think as if you
were  
seeing or doing something for the first time. Beginners aren’t  
usually proud or boastful. They are impressionable. Beginners don’t  
already <b>know</b> why things are the way they are or what the best
course  
of action is at any given moment. They’re more likely to actually  
stop and look around them.

This strikes a chord with the solo pairing idea. As we program lone,  
there’s a lot of seemingly autonomous stuff that can happen without  
any intentional thought. We get into a rhythm, not noticing the
familiar  
scenery around us. Like driving to work every day, we are dulled to
the  
routine of the environment in which we work. Think about it next time
you  
sit down by yourself to write a program: How conscious are you of the
names  
you choose for variables, methods, or classes? For the "easy&quot;  
problems, how critical are you of your own norms and rituals? I’m not  
suggesting that you aren’t <b>conscientious</b>—in fact it  
might be conscientiousness that has led many of us to a rigid (most of
us  
prefer to say "correct&quot;) way of approaching many of life’s  
little problems.

</p>
<p>
But, when you’re sitting with another person—especially if this  
person is a beginner—they’re not inside your head with you.  
They’re more likely to question your established protocol. "Why  
do you put ‘p underscore’ in those variable names?" This  
might be a little frustrating at first until you irritatedly answer,  
"Because it shows that they’re parameters to the method. Our old  
code’s methods were so long and jumbled that you often couldn’t  
remember where a variable was declared, so we had to do this. Thank
God  
we’ve stopped coding like that…hmm, why <b>do</b> I put those  
‘p underscore’s there?"

</p>

Dave asks:

</p>
      &quot;However, doing this six months after you write code is not the best way
       of developing good software today. So the underlying challenge of this
       kata is this: how can we get into the habit of critically reviewing
       the code that we write, as we write it?&quot;

<p>
Maybe we could replace the word "critically&quot; here with  
"innocently&quot; to achieve a different but still beneficial effect?
