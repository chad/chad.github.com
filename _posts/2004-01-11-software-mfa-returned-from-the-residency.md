I’ve just returned from the <a
href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA">trial</a> of the Software MFA <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/MFASoftware.rdoc">program</a>  
that Dick Gabriel (<a href="http://dreamsongs.com">dreamsongs.com</a>)
<a
href="http://dreamsongs.com/MFASoftware.html">proposed</a>.

<p>
I’m exhausted and will say more about this later, but I do want to  
say that thanks to Dick Gabriel, Ralph Johnson, and Brian Marick, this  
event was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. I can’t  
wait until the program "officially&quot; starts at UIUC. I’ll be  
there.
