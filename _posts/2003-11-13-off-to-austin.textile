Tomorrow morning (way too early), I&#8217;m off to Austin to attend
RubyConf 2003 (<a
href="http://www.rubycentral.org/03">www.rubycentral.org/03</a>).

<p>
If I can get myself &#8216;net-connected in Austin and the planets and my
mood align just right, I&#8217;ll be updating in near real time with news
from the conference.
</p>
<p>
Internet connectivity is the lone requirement for me to start dumping
webcam shots every two minutes here: <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/images/rubyconf">chadfowler.com/images/rubyconf</a>.
I&#8217;ve put a lovely Miro placeholder there until the real images start
rolling in.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;re in Austin and interested in Ruby, dynamic languages, open
source, etc. we&#8217;ll be accepting late registrations at the door. Chale
chalo!
