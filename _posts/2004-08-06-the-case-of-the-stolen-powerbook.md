It’s been a while since I’ve posted here. This is mostly  
because I’ve been busy but at least partially because I’ve been  
a little demotivated to sit in front of a computer for much time. My  
friends and family are tired of hearing me whine about it, but my
Powerbook  
was stolen while traveling on a train in Brussels about a month ago.

<p>
I’m not going to whine any further here; The story has a happy  
ending. There may be some useful information for laptop owners to take
with  
them:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
When you’re traveling with your computer, keep it closer to you than  
you think you have to. I had mine in an inconspicuous backpack case and
had  
it right near me. If someone’s targeting travelers, they’re  
going to look for people who are <em>almost</em> keeping a good enough
eye  
on their possessions. Those are the people who think everything is going
to  
be OK and won’t notice that something has happened until it’s  
too late.

</li>
<li>
Ultimately, my homeowner’s insurance paid for the *full price* to  
replace my laptop! I’m kind of ignorant about these things and had no  
idea that homeowner’s insurance would cover a loss while I was  
traveling. If you own a home (or rent?) and have some kind of insurance,
I  
would recommend finding out if you’re covered before something like  
this happens to you. Some credit card companies offer similar coverage
on  
purchases made with their cards. The card I used does not, so if you
have a  
choice of which one to use, use the one that will cover potential
losses.

</li>
<li>
An obvious one: I had spotty network connectivity while traveling, so I
was  
backing up things I was working on onto a USB drive in case of
hardware  
failure on my laptop. Guess where I stored the USB drive? I lost hours
of  
work, some of which I’ll probably never get around to redoing.

</li>
<li>
Don’t get a Mac. It’s just too hard to go back to the  
alternatives once you’ve gone there. Save yourself some suffering and  
stick with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">least common  
denominator</a>.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> SMS’d me earlier to  
tell me that my new Powerbook is sitting at home in the box waiting for
me  
to spend way too much time setting up and playing with this weekend. :)
