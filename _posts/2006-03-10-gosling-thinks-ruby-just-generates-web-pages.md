James Gosling, father of the <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000568.html">Java programming  
language</a>, <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146.htm">thinks
Ruby  
is just for generating web pages</a>.

He’s wrong of course, but you already knew that.

</p>
<p>
What’s notable here isn’t that he’s wrong and we need to  
defend Ruby from his ignorance. What’s notable is that the  
<em>guy</em> who’s supposed to be carrying Java forward is completely  
clueless about the <em>real</em> competition. My guess is that he  
completely understands the challenges C\# brings. It’s easy to  
understand. It’s just like Java.

If this is who Sun has driving their language and platform strategy,
Java  
may not be the conservative choice of programming technology (for
long)  
that you might believe it to be.

IBM thought PCs were silly in the early 80s. Not a threat. Not where
the  
market is. Not big. Not scalable.

<p>
Oops.
