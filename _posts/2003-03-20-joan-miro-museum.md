Today, we visited the Fundacio Miro (<a
href="http://www.bcn.fjmiro.es">www.bcn.fjmiro.es</a>), which is  
deceptively close to our hotel. I say deceptively, because, while it
was  
the shortest walk we’ve taken so far on this trip, it’s  
straight up hill from here. We made the mistake of this being the
first  
morning that we’ve skipped breakfast, which made it extra  
frustrating. I can feel myself getting older. I can’t remember a time  
five years ago when I lamented not having eaten breakfast.

<p>
I really enjoy museums that are dedicated to a single artist. We saw
works  
spanning from when Miro was eight years old to around the time he
died.  
I’m far from what you would call an art enthusiast, and I’m  
horribly ignorant by most counts, but a format like this allows me to
walk  
through and observe—in a very obvious way—how the artist  
changed over time.

</p>
<p>
This is the second such museum I’ve visited—the first being the  
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (<a
href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl">www.vangoghmuseum.nl</a>). We made
a  
failed attempt to see the Edvard Munch Museum (<a
href="http://www.museumsnett.no/munchmuseet">www.museumsnett.no/munchmuseet</a>)  
in Oslo, but after a long (and also fully uphill) walk, it was closed.  
Disappointing, but not nearly as much as our post-5-mile-walk view of
the  
Brandenburg Gate (<a
href="http://www.dailysoft.com/east-berlin/mitte/bgate.htm">www.dailysoft.com/east-berlin/mitte/bgate.htm</a>),  
covered for construction and featuring a cartoonish, life sized  
<b>picture</b> of the monument.

</p>
<p>
Something I noticed as a potential pattern today is that many of the
great  
20th century artists started off in realism and ended in the Avant
Garde.  
This doesn’t apply to just painting, but also to music and writing  
(at least). A notable musical example is Albert Ayler (<a
href="http://www.ayler.supanet.com">www.ayler.supanet.com</a>),
bebop-esque  
saxophonist who ended his career playing purely emotional, energized
music  
rendered in a loose framework more reminiscent of the world’s  
national anthems than jazz standards, or Arnold Schoenberg, the founder
of  
atonal music in the Western classical tradition. As I walked through
the  
Miro museum, I thought a lot about why this happens. And—a longer  
topic I won’t get into—how this might apply to computer  
programming, if you buy into the idea that programming is an art form.
More  
on this later…

Something that specifically caught my attention about Miro is that, as
a  
lover of poetry, he wanted to find a way to express poetry through
visual  
art. He was quoted (though I’m not sure of the exact quote nor the  
source since I read it in the museum) as saying that he both blurred
the  
distinction between art and poetry and appreciated poetry in terms of
its  
potential visual representations. I would normally dismiss this kind
of  
talk as the pretentious ramblings of a self-obssessed "Artiste&quot;,  
but Miro actually took some apparent steps to realize his desire to
merge  
poetry and art. Over time (crystalizing in the early  
1930’s—which seems to be my favorite period of his work) he  
developed an iconographic vocabulary or "visual language&quot; which  
formed the basis of most of his work for the rest of his life. With
this  
"language&quot;, he developed visual "poems&quot; that presumably  
had some meaning beyond the abstract shapes, colors, and textures that
we  
laypeople see when we look at them. I searched the museum book shop for
a  
"Miro Visual Phrasebook&quot; but didn’t find one (though we  
<b>did</b> find some placemats with pictures and their associated
meanings  
in French). It’s possible (though beside the point, really) that  
I’m making more of this than Miro did, but the idea of a visual (or  
audial, for that matter) meta-language for embedding meaning in art has
a  
definite appeal to the musician/computer-geek/wannabe-linguist in me.

</p>
<p>
As a composer (of music), I was always annoyed by conversations that  
started with: "What are you trying to <b>say</b> with this  
piece?" <b>Nothing</b>. I’m not trying to say <b>anything</b>.  
It’s <b>music</b>, I thought. In fact, I was particularily impressed  
today by the fact that many of Miro’s paintings are titled  
"Painting&quot;. In the same vein, my last piece of music was called  
"Quartet&quot;. But, with Miro’s meta-language, maybe his  
paintings really <b>are</b> "saying something&quot; in the literal  
sense. Why not? The challenge of marrying the encoded meaning and the  
aesthetic and more fuzzy aspects of the piece would be especially  
interesting. Maybe this is what David Morgan-Mar had in mind when he  
created the Piet Programming Language (<a
href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html">www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html</a>),  
in which programs are "written&quot; as digital abstract art.

</p>
<p>
As an aside, there was one painting in the entire exhibit that drew my  
attention more than any other. I saw it from across the room and had
to  
wait behind a crowd of people who were chatting before getting a close  
look. I was a bit surprised when Kelly read the title to me:

</p>
<h1>
Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement

</h1>
<p>
<img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/excrement.jpg">

</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t ya know I would pick a picture of excrement to be interested  
in.

Perhaps tomorrow we’ll tour the Picasso museum.
