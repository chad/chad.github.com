As American and European software developers, we are increasingly
exposed  
to people from "low cost countries&quot; such as India, China, and  
various places in Eastern Europe. As I say in the wrap-up to <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">My Job
Went  
to India</a>, love it or hate it, working with people from around the
world  
is a skill that serious software developers need to cultivate.

<p>
I happen to know a lot about India. I speak Hindi. My <a
href="http://kellyjeanne.org">wife</a> and I lived in Bangalore for a
year  
and a half. We enjoy Indian movies, we <em>love</em> Indian food, and
we  
listen to a lot of Indian music. And, most relevant here, I know how
to  
work with Indian software developers. It’s fair to say that, by US  
standards, I am an expert when it comes to Indian culture.

</p>
<p>
Cultural understanding is the backbone of a good working relationship
with  
<em>anyone</em> (even understanding corporate vs. hacker culture). So
I  
thought I’d try to help out with some fundamentals.

</p>
<p>
Imagine a new person showing up to work on your team and asking where he
or  
she needed to <em>FPT</em> a file to or which version of  
<em>Serversion</em> you were using for version control. How impressed
would  
you be? How much confidence would you have in the person? This is the
kind  
of person that ends up being <a
href="http://thedailywtf.com/">lampooned</a> on the web.

</p>
<p>
If working with India is an important job skill, then horribly  
mispronouncing the name "Chandra&quot; or "Rohit&quot; is as bad  
a transgression as mispronouncing "Subversion&quot; or constantly  
referring to the Web as "The Dub Dub Dub&quot;. It’s probably  
worse, considering that many (most?) Indian names are based on the names
of  
gods. It’s one thing to potentially insult someone by mispronouncing  
<em>their</em> name. It’s another altogether to butcher the name of  
their <em>god</em>.

</p>
<p>
In this post I won’t give you enough to make you 100% accurate, but I  
can give you a few rules of thumb that will cover the vast majority of  
problems that I’ve seen Americans have:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
More often than you’d think, Indian names have the emphasis on the  
first syllable. This is the number one mistake I hear Americans making
with  
Indian names. Even when you hear someone saying a name with the
emphasis  
the right way, it somehow feels natural to us to emphasize the second
(or  
later) syllable.

</li>
<li>
Don’t assume a long "a&quot; sound. Over time, we Americans have  
taught ourselves to at least <em>attempt</em> to pronounce European
names  
correctly. We naturally try to apply the same rules to Indian names. If
you  
see a "a&quot;, it will either have the sound of "cut&quot; (most  
common) or "a&quot; as in "father&quot;—NEVER "a&quot;  
as in "bake&quot;.

</li>
<li>
"e&quot; is always as in a cross between "leg&quot; and  
"lay&quot; and never as in "Steve&quot; or the second syllable of  
"clever&quot;. So "Suresh&quot; would be pronounced "Soo  
<em>Raysh</em>"

</li>
<li>
"i&quot; is always as in "hit&quot; or the vowel sound of  
"clean&quot;. Never "i&quot; as in "life&quot;.

</li>
<li>
"u&quot; is always like "foot&quot; or "brute&quot;. Never  
like "cut&quot;.

</li>
<li>
"o&quot; is always like "flow&quot;. Never like "hot&quot;.

</li>
<li>
There aren’t many "special&quot; rules. In English,  
"ch&quot; can mean "sh&quot; in some cases. When you see Indian  
names with "ch&quot; in them, the "ch&quot; is always as in  
"Chair&quot;.

</li>
<li>
There is no "th&quot; sound like we have in English. "th&quot;  
makes an aspirated (harder and breathier) "t&quot; sound. If you  
can’t hear and/or reproduce the aspiration, it’s better to err  
on the side of "t&quot; as in "Tom&quot; as opposed to  
"th&quot; as in "the&quot;. "th&quot; as in "the&quot;  
will always be wrong.

</li>
<li>
"j&quot; is pronounced like an English "j&quot;. Don’t try  
to Spanishize it into "h&quot;.

</li>
<li>
When you meet someone from another country, take the time to ask them
how  
to pronounce their name. Then try it and have them correct you. They  
won’t be offended. They will appreciate the fact that you actually  
tried.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some examples:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
"Rohit Thakur&quot; - <em>Row</em> hit <em>Tah</em> koor

</li>
<li>
"Ramesh&quot; - Ruh <em>mesh</em>

</li>
<li>
"Chandra&quot; - <em>Chun</em> druh

</li>
<li>
"Venkatesh&quot; - <em>Ven</em> kah tesh

</li>
<li>
"Rashmi&quot; - <em>Rush</em> me

</li>
<li>
"Uday&quot; - oo <em>day</em> (not "You day&quot;)

</li>
<li>
"Ramana&quot; - <em>Rah</em> muh nuh (Don’t emphasize the second  
syllable, making it sound like "Ramada (inn)")

</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a href="http://halostatue.ca/">Austin Ziegler</a> helped make my
language  
less ambiguous, Fred LeMaster suggests

<li>
Fred LeMaster suggests watching English-language Indian movies (there
are  
some really good ones!) to help learn the pronunciation. Some
suggestions  
(his and mine) are <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0265343/">Monsoon  
Wedding</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0109206/">Bandit
Queen</a>,  
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0150433/">Earth</a>, and <a

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://climbtothestars.org/">Stephanie Booth</a> pointed out
that  
"what&quot; isn’t pronounced the same everywhere, so I changed  
the example to use "cut&quot;
