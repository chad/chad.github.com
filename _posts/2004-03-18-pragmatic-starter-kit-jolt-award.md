Congratulations, <a

and

Nice  
to see someone make a courageous move and have it pay off.

<p>
If you haven’t read these books yet (and you’re a software  
developer), you really should do yourself a favor and make the time.  
Don’t let "Starter&quot; in the title fool you. Sure, the books  
are about fundamental and could be used as a "starter kit&quot; (as  
the name suggests). But, greatness is (almost always) built on strong  
fundamentals, and you’re never too good to need more practice.
