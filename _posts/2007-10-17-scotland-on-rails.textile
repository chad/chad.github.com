When I was in middle school, my friends and I started a rock band.  We picked a name; we had a logo.  If we'd had money the next obvious step would have been to print band t-shirts.  This all happened, of course, before we ever learned to play any relevant instruments (saxophone and bassoon don't count).

For well over a year, I've been wearing a Scotland on Rails shirt.  Scotland on Rails has a name, a logo, and t-shirts.  

Now they've got "a conference":http://scotlandonrails.com.

Organized in part by my good friend and big thinker,  "Alan C. Francis":http://www.alancfrancis.com/, Scotland on Rails is sure to be a great time.  If you're in or around the UK, I highly recommend putting it on  your calendar (or at the very least considering a "mouse pad or pair of boxers":http://www.cafepress.com/scotlandonrails).
