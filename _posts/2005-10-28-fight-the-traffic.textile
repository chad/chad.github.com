I got in a cab last night heading from Washington D.C. to the Dulles
airport. I was a block from the White House and traffic was stopped behind
a crowd that was pushing its way in to see the president.

<p>
The old Ethiopian cab driver suddenly kicked the taxi into gear and zipped
around a line of cars, edging us five cars closer to freedom.

<p>
&quot;I <em>hate</em> traffic&quot;, he grumbled.
</p>
<p>
&quot;You picked the wrong job, then, didn&#8217;t you?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;No! I <em>love</em> my job. My job is to fight the traffic.&quot;
