Update: Being the King of Good Timing, I posted this entry the day before
Alex renamed rvsh to &quot;ruvi&quot; (nice name!) and broke all of the
links in this post. The links should now work.

<p>
I&#8217;m not sure this will become a weekly habit, but I&#8217;ve been
enjoying <a href="http://onestepback.org">Jim's</a> &quot;Module
Spotlights&quot;, and thought I&#8217;d do something similar to give a
little exposure to some of the nice <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems">RubyGems packages</a> that
are now out there for the taking.
</p>
<p>
This week&#8217;s featured gem is &quot;ruvi&quot; [<a
href="http://www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml">www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml</a>].
It was created by <a href="http://www.lypanov.net">Alexander Kellett</a>,
and is a <a href="http://vim.sf.net">vim</a> clone written in _pure Ruby_!
</p>
<p>
So, if you&#8217;ve got the latest <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126">RubyGems</a> distribution (go
get it!), you can do this:
</p>
<pre>
        $ sudo gem -Ri ruvi --install-stub
        Attempting remote installation of 'ruvi'
        Successfully installed ruvi version 0.4.5

        $ ruvi RvshGem.rdoc
</pre>
<p>
You&#8217;ll see something that looks like this:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
(though if you&#8217;ve got your terminal configured properly, it will look
a lot better that this).
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s still early in development, but it has a surprising number of
features implemented. I actually used it to create this weblog entry. I
think I could waste a few hours having fun hacking in features that I never
had the energy to do in vim script or Emacs Lisp.
</p>
<p>
Now that you&#8217;ve got the latest RubyGems distribution, try:
</p>
<pre>
      $ gem -R --list
</pre>
<p>
There are a lot of lovely gems already out there. And, of course, armed
with the RubyGems distribution, you are now equipped to create more.
</p>
