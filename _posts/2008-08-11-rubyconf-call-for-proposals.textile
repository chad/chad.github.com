It's that time of year again!  We're now "accepting proposals":http://rubyconf.org/proposals/new for the "8th International Ruby Conference":http://rubyconf.org.  RubyConf will be in Orlando, FL this year on November 6-8.

We're closing the proposal process on Aug. 21, so don't delay too much if you're just now seeing this. That's 10 days from today.

While we're on the subject, what topics would you be interested in seeing this year?
