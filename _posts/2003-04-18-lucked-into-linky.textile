I just switched to using Phoenix (<a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix">www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix</a>)
as my primary browser, and decided to go hunting for some extensions last
night. I hit gold: Linky (<a
href="http://linky.mozdev.org/">linky.mozdev.org/</a>), the Mozilla/Phoenix
extension of my dreams.

<p>
With Linky, you can&#8212;among other things&#8212;select an area of text
and open any selected links in separate browser tabs. And, with Phoenix,
the default new-tab behaviour is to open each tab in the background. So,
when I start my browsing sessions now, I can select the links down the
right-hand side of this page and&#8212;with one command&#8212;open them all
simultaneously in separate tabs. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for an
extension to better match my browsing behaviour. (I actually use my own
website as a bookmark list for sites I regularly visit).
</p>
<p>
I might be the only person I know who would get excited about this feature,
but I thought I&#8217;d share it just in case.
