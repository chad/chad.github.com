Tomorrow morning (way too early), I’m off to Austin to attend  
RubyConf 2003 (<a
href="http://www.rubycentral.org/03">www.rubycentral.org/03</a>).

<p>
If I can get myself ‘net-connected in Austin and the planets and my  
mood align just right, I’ll be updating in near real time with news  
from the conference.

</p>
<p>
Internet connectivity is the lone requirement for me to start dumping  
webcam shots every two minutes here: <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/images/rubyconf">chadfowler.com/images/rubyconf</a>.  
I’ve put a lovely Miro placeholder there until the real images start  
rolling in.

</p>
<p>
If you’re in Austin and interested in Ruby, dynamic languages, open  
source, etc. we’ll be accepting late registrations at the door. Chale  
chalo!
