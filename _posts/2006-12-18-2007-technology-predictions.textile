So, it looks like I missed the submission deadline for sys-con&#8217;s now
annual <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/313594.htm">i-Technology
predictions</a> (sorry Jeremy!). I was just browsing the submissions that
made it in, and the following separate post caught my eye: Yakov
Fain&#8217;s <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/315210.htm">Ruby on
Rails Won't Make It in 2007 and Forget About AJAX</a>.

<p>
It&#8217;s funny that almost every prediction Yakov makes is about an
innovation <em>not</em> mattering, <em>not</em> being adopted, and
<em>not</em> resulting in any real change to our industry.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not sure what industry Yakov is in, but I&#8217;m glad the IT
industry isn&#8217;t anything like what he predicts. If I had to live in a
world like the one he apparently lives in, I think I&#8217;d be looking for
a career switch.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s my single 2007 prediction:
</p>
<p>
2005 started a trend that got stronger in 2006 and will explode in 2007:
with tools and technologies like Rails and Ajax challenging the way a lot
of us have been conceiving of the limits of internet technology and the
software development process, the software development world&#8217;s
leading edge will take a tangible, industry-wide step forward. Yakov and
his readers will continue to not get it.
