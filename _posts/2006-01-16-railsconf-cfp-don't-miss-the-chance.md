The <a href="http://railsconf.org/talks">RailsConf Call for  
Participation</a> is drawing to a close. Two more weeks to get those
talk  
proposals in. Don’t miss the chance to speak at the <a
href="http://railsconf.org">First International Rails Conference</a>.  
We’ve got a ton of great proposals, so if your talk is selected,  
you’ll be in good company. We’ve also got some exciting  
announcements lined up in the area of keynotes, so keep your eyes
peeled.
