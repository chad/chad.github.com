For centuries, Buddhists have practiced a meditation technique called  
Visualization. The practice involves reconstructing every minute detail
of  
a complex Thangka painting (e.g. <a
href="http://www.tibetshop.com/gs363.html">www.tibetshop.com/gs363.html</a>)  
from memory in one’s mind. The ultimate aim is to be able to hold an  
entire complex image in your mind at once, as if actually looking at
the  
painting.

<p>
As with many (if not all) of the Buddhist meditative practices, the goal
of  
this meditation is to practice focusing and controlling the mind.  
Scientific studies have shown that Buddhist meditative practices such
as  
visualization have a signficant physical effect on where and how
activity  
occurs in the brain. Additionally, it has been proven that intense
practice  
in various disciplines signficantly increases the physical development
of  
the brain in areas associated with positive thought.(1) Mental practice
and  
development is analogous to physical exercise, with your mental  
"muscles&quot; getting materially stronger with practice.

<h2>
What to do

</h2>
<p>
(If you are new to the term "Code Kata&quot;, visit Dave’s site:  
<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata</a>.  
This Kata will require more than one sitting. Start small and increase
in  
complexity over time. Continue with a single piece of code until  
you’ve mastered it or until you see no value in continuing.)

</p>
<p>
Pick a piece of code that you consider to be of extremely high
quality.  
Ideally, this should be sized somewhere between the huge (the Linux
kernel  
source) and the tiny ("Cookbook&quot; snippets). For maximum  
utilitarian benefit, find a piece of software that you would like to  
enhance your understanding of. Open source programmers might choose,
for  
example, the standard library of their programming language of choice.

</p>
<p>
Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. Start with a  
moderately small piece of your chosen code base and study it intensely
for  
20 to 30 minutes. You can start out with as small a chunk as you like.  
After your period of study, sit back, close your eyes (if you like),
relax,  
and try to reconstruct the code in your mind. You might start with
classes  
(in an object oriented program), fill the classes out with methods and  
instance variables, and eventually fill out the method bodies. Follow
the  
logical flow from one method to the next. Enumerate the classes,
variables,  
and methods in your mind.

</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you could spend sessions trying to reconstruct a
graphical  
representation of the code—perhaps UML. Class diagrams and sequence  
diagrams would probably be a good start, though converting source to UML
in  
your head might prove to be harder than remembering the code itself. A
mix  
of code and visual representation might be a good place to end up.
Feel  
free to experiment and season to taste.

</p>
<p>
Set a time limit for the exercise. 10-15 minutes would probably be a
good  
start. Adjust as your experience dictates. Try not to let your mind
wander  
during the time that you have allotted. As other thoughts enter your
mind  
(e.g. "Why am I doing this? This is silly. What should I have for  
dinner?") push them gently away and focus on the code. (As the  
Buddhist medidators would probably add, we all get distracted. Don’t  
be distracted by the fact that you’re getting distracted. Don’t  
punish yourself. Just go back to the code.)

</p>
<p>
Slowly add more and more of the full code base as you practice in  
subsequent days and weeks. Add code one "module&quot; at a time, until  
you eventually (if ever) are able to hold your entire chosen code base
in  
your mind.

</p>
<h2>
Goals

</h2>
<p>
There are two primary goals to this exercise, one with immediate
visible  
benefit—the other with a potentially longer term effect:

</p>
<h3>
Immediate/Visible

</h3>
<p>
Great conductors commit entire symphonies to memory. That might be 30  
minutes worth of black dots written for potentially 100+ simultaneous  
(instrumental) voices. I’ve heard some say that it greatly enhances  
their ability to <b>hear</b> the piece. If these pieces happen to be
the  
work of a "master&quot;, what better way is there to stamp a piece of  
that master’s work on your mind?

</p>
<p>
In music, this has the very pragmatic side effect that a conductor can  
quickly and efficiently work with an orchestra that is playing a piece
that  
the conductor has committed to memory. The same is true in software.
No  
need to look up that function from the API documentation. And you’re  
more likely to find the "optimal&quot; solution to a problem, if you  
are intimately familiar with the tools available to do the job. You
can  
drive a screw into a board with a hammer, but if only you knew about
that  
screw driver, life would be much easier.

</p>
<h3>
Longer Term/Esoteric

</h3>
<p>
Unless you have photographic memory, reconstructing large pieces of code
in  
your mind is an extremely difficult thing to do. If you’re like me,  
you have trouble committing even small pieces to memory. This is like  
weight lifting for the mind. You will develop new "muscles&quot; that  
you never knew you had. Your mind will find new ways to associate,  
generalize, and ultimately simplify the complexities of the software
for  
you. Be warned that you might not see it or feel it after one  
attempt—or even 10. Another analogy from music: Do you think jazz  
improvisers actually think of the name and finger position of every
note  
they play before they play it? The answer is "no&quot;. Their minds  
can’t work that fast. The details get grouped into gestures and  
generalizations—most of them completely subconcious.

</p>
<p>
And, of course, if you believe the scientists and Buddhist scholars  
involved with the Mind and Life Institue (<a
href="http://www.mindandlife.org">www.mindandlife.org</a>), you may  
potentially develop your mental abilities in a way that would contribute
to  
any activity requiring concentration, including the quest for happiness.

<h2>
Questions

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Are there pieces of code or styles of design that are easier to
visualize  
than others?

</li>
<li>
What seems to drive your ability to hold certain pieces of code in
your  
mind over others?

</li>
<li>
Do you think these drivers are the same for everyone, or do they vary
by  
individual? Might this realization affect the way you write your own
code?

</li>
<li>
What mental tricks might you subconciously be developing to manage
this  
complexity?

Sidenote

</h3>
<p>
This isn’t really a "Kata&quot; (<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/CodeKata.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/CodeKata.rdoc,v</a>).  
It doesn’t really fall into the Kumite or Koan categories (<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/MoreKata.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/MoreKata.rdoc,v</a>)  
either. But, it’s definitely an example of Practice (<a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Bowling.html">www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Bowling.html</a>),  
though a somewhat strange one. And in case you’re wondering,  
I’m not Buddhist.
