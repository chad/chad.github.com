<p>
Three years ago tomorrow (my memory isn’t that good—I happened  
to make a web post about it), I finished reading what would turn out to
be  
one of the most influential books of my computer programming career,
The  
Pragmatic Programmer, by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas (<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com</a>).  
Since then, I’ve followed their articles, weblogs (see the links on  
the right) and like many others have anticipated the release of their
next  
book.

</p>
<p>
Taking a surprising turn, they have recently announced the formation
of  
their own publishing entity and have simultaneously released two new
books.  
Today, my copies of "Pragmatic Unit Testing&quot; and "Pragmatic  
Version Control&quot; arrived.

</p>
<p>
They seem to be catering to the future Pragmatic Programmer market
with  
material of a more introductory nature. So, the material may be a bit
on  
the basic side. This is why they are calling these books a  
"prequel&quot; as opposed to a true follow-up to Pragmatic Programmer.

</p>
<p>
As long as there’s no mention of Jar Jar (<a
href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0120915/Ss/0120915/fcstil_1155.jpg?path=pgallery&path_key=Best,%20Ahmed">www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0120915/Ss/0120915/fcstil\_1155.jpg?path=pgallery&path\_key=Best,%20Ahmed</a>)  
I’ll be happy. And, you can never hear good advice too many times.

</p>
<p>
While I obviously haven’t read these books yet, I’m going to go  
out on a limb and pre-recommend them to you in case you don’t know  
anything about them. If they’re even nearly as good as the first one,  
they will take their place in my list of require reading materials for
any  
new programmer. <a

(Incidentally, 3 years ago today was the day I first downloaded Ruby
\[<a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>\]. This was
actually  
also a result of reading The Pragmatic Programmer and the  
learn-one-language-per-year tip.)
