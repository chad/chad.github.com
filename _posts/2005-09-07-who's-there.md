In <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went
to  
India</a>, I stress the importance of writing as a way to build your  
personal brand and make yourself more marketable. I specifically
suggest  
that software developers open a weblog.

<p>
Marketing maverick <a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> just <a
href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/whos_there_the_.html">published  
a free ebook</a> called "Who’s There?" that goes into much  
greater depth about the how and why of blogging.

</p>
<p>
Why bother? Seth says:

</p>
            If you care about your personal brand and career and impact, you need a
            blog. And you should start the cycle of getting better at blogging.

<p>
A favorite quote:

</p>
            When you apply for a job, so do a thousand other people.
            When you see a house listing, so do a thousand other people.
            When you bid on a grilled cheese sandwich on eBay, so do a thousand other people.

<p>
mmmm.…grilled cheese.

Anyway, I’ve <a

here</a>  
if you’re interested. It’s a short and very worthwhile read.
