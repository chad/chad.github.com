An <a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ruby-rails/2951980">interesting  
post</a> came through on the
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>  
mailing list today.

      Hi,
      having read &quot;my job went to india&quot; I decided to quit programming within
      the Microsoft environment and start something different...

      So, is there any RubyOnRails project that in exchange for &quot;reviving&quot; me
      needs a loyal (code) contributor?

      Thanks in advance
      Michael

Welcome, Michael. You’ve taken the first step: <em>acting</em> on  
your <em>own</em> behalf.

</p>
<p>
It’s heartening to see this kind of thing happen as a result of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">words I have  
written</a>. I’m not going to definitively say that moving away from  
.NET is the right move for Michael. But <em>deciding</em> to control
the  
course of his career <em>is</em> the right move. He may fear the
Offshoring  
tide. Or he may have even already been laid off. (Or neither). But
sitting  
around being scared, shaking your fist at Lou Dobbs’ propaganda on  
CNN isn’t going to get you anywhere. The only way to get anywhere is  
to <em>move</em>.

</p>
<p>
That’s what Michael is doing. Good going, Michael!
