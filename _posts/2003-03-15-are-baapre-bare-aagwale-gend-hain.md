Spur of the moment, we decided to take a vacation. Two days later,  
we’ve got tickets and hotel reservations in Barcelona.

<p>
Busy with work, I haven’t taken the time to learn <b>anything</b>  
about what Spain will be like. I know two things:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
We’ve never been there before.

</li>
<li>
A lot of people will probably speak Spanish (though, in Barcelona, the  
predominant language seems to be Catalan (<a
href="http://www.june29.com/HLP/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html">www.june29.com/HLP/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html</a>)).

</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Are nested parentheses an intuitive construct for non-programming
readers  
of English?)

</p>
<p>
I hope the Catalonians won’t be too offended if we try to speak  
Spanish to them. I don’t think we have time to learn Catalan.

</p>
<p>
So, a week and a half from now, I’ll be back—hopefully  
refreshed and having risen my once-decent knowledge of basic Spanish
from  
the dead. If there’s anything interesting to look at in Spain, I  
might even post a picture or two.

</p>
<p>
Hasta la vista.
