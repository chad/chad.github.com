So, it looks like I missed the submission deadline for sys-con’s now  
annual <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/313594.htm">i-Technology  
predictions</a> (sorry Jeremy!). I was just browsing the submissions
that  
made it in, and the following separate post caught my eye: Yakov  
Fain’s <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/315210.htm">Ruby on  
Rails Won’t Make It in 2007 and Forget About AJAX</a>.

<p>
It’s funny that almost every prediction Yakov makes is about an  
innovation <em>not</em> mattering, <em>not</em> being adopted, and  
<em>not</em> resulting in any real change to our industry.

</p>
<p>
I’m not sure what industry Yakov is in, but I’m glad the IT  
industry isn’t anything like what he predicts. If I had to live in a  
world like the one he apparently lives in, I think I’d be looking for  
a career switch.

</p>
<p>
Here’s my single 2007 prediction:

</p>
<p>
2005 started a trend that got stronger in 2006 and will explode in
2007:  
with tools and technologies like Rails and Ajax challenging the way a
lot  
of us have been conceiving of the limits of internet technology and
the  
software development process, the software development world’s  
leading edge will take a tangible, industry-wide step forward. Yakov
and  
his readers will continue to not get it.
