While I was working on "The Passionate Programmer":http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer I had the following Kurt Vonnegut quote (from "A Man Without A Country":http://www.amazon.com/Man-Without-Country-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/158322713X) at the top of the introduction. Right before we published it, my editor reminded me that we had to get permission to print it. I was unable to reach anyone from Kurt Vonnegut's estate on time, so I commented the quote out in the book's source.

This is how The Passionate Programmer was supposed to begin:

  "I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'" -- Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.
