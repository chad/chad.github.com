I&#8217;ve just switched to what I think is the 5th piece of software that
I&#8217;ve used to power this site since its inception. Unlike every other
switch I&#8217;ve made, this one is done because it&#8217;s <b>better</b>
than the others. I can say that with a clear conscience, because I&#8217;ve
personally written almost all of the software that has run this site, and I
know that the motivation behind almost every other switch I&#8217;ve made
is nothing more than boredom and the desire to try something new.

<p>
<a href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a> is written in Ruby
(<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>), which has been
a constant for me for the past two years. It supports CVS, categories, and
multiple different file formats. Have a look here: <a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v</a>.

One important thing to keep in mind is that, though my site is ugly,
it&#8217;s always been ugly. You can&#8217;t blame this on <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a>&#8217;s creator
(although if you think Dave&#8217;s site is ugly, you can blame <b>that</b>
on him). :)

Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I can upload MS Word
documents and have them appear as weblog entries. Not because I want to use
Word, but because it&#8217;ll be cool.
