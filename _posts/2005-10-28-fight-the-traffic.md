I got in a cab last night heading from Washington D.C. to the Dulles  
airport. I was a block from the White House and traffic was stopped
behind  
a crowd that was pushing its way in to see the president.

<p>
The old Ethiopian cab driver suddenly kicked the taxi into gear and
zipped  
around a line of cars, edging us five cars closer to freedom.

</p>
<p>
"I <em>hate</em> traffic&quot;, he grumbled.

</p>
<p>
"You picked the wrong job, then, didnâ€™t you?"

</p>
<p>
"No! I <em>love</em> my job. My job is to fight the traffic."
