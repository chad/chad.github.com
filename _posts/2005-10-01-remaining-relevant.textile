While you wait for your copy of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">My Job
Went to India</a> to arrive, you may want to warm up by reading <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/RemainingRelevant.pdf">Remaining Relevant</a>,
an article I wrote for the May/June issue of <a
href="http://www.bettersoftware.com">Better Software Magazine</a>. It
touches the same issues but from just above the 50,000 foot mark.

<p>
I recommend reading it Monday morning before you go to work. Download it
and save it for breakfast reading. A good way to start the week.

Thanks to <a href="http://testing.com/cgi-bin/blog">Brian Marick</a> for
reminding me that the article wasn&#8217;t linked yet.
