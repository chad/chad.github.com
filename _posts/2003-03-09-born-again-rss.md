Austin Ziegler has revived (<a
href="http://ruby-rss.sourceforge.net/">ruby-rss.sourceforge.net/</a>)
my  
Ruby RSS module from the dead. He’s rewritten it to use REXML (<a
href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/XML/rexml_stable/">www.germane-software.com/software/XML/rexml\_stable/</a>),  
which I had actually finished 6 months ago but never uploaded and has
also  
added support for RSS 0.92 and RSS 2.0. So, if you want to do some
really  
nice, easy , validating RSS creation or parsing, head over and check  
Austin’s code out. If you have existing code that uses my old module,  
it should work with few or no changes. He hasn’t released the new  
version yet, so you’ll have to get it from CVS. I’m sure  
he’d love to have some beta testers.

<p>
I thought I’d get around to helping him finish up or maybe even  
adding RSS 1.0 support, but so far I haven’t been able to muster the  
gumption. I guess RSS has finally fallen into the category of things  
I’d like to **just work** without any effort on my part. Thanks to  
Austin for making it so.
