A <a
href="http://www.ntecs.de/blog/Blog/HumanUnderstandabilityRuby.rdoc">very  
interesting post</a> by Michael Neumann (who also maintains a <a
href="http://www.ntecs.de/old-hp/uu9r/lang/html/lang.en.html">fabulous
site  
with hundreds of programming language examples</a>), where he walks
through  
various aspects of the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>
programming  
language with his (not-a-programmer) girlfriend and asks her to
explain  
what different pieces of sample code mean.

<p>
She (and Ruby) do remarkably well. Kind of a neat idea.

</p>
<p>
I’ve said for years that (in the Java world) at a certain layer of  
your application’s design, an interesting test of its  
readability/maintainability is whether or not your (not-a-programmer)  
customer(s) can read and understand it. I would hate to see how some of
the  
projects I’ve worked on would stand up to such a  
test—especially the Java ones.
