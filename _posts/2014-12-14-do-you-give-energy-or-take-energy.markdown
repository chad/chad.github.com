As you interact with other people in the world, you either generate energy or you deplete it. In a team environment, there are people who always bring the team’s energy level up. When they are absent, you miss it. They somehow direct the flow of conversation and events from dead ends to forward motion. When you discuss a problem with them, you feel better afterward.

And, of course, there are those who have the opposite effect. Any debate becomes an exhausting fight. Negative events are followed by even more negative responses. Hard problems become drudgery. Optimism turns into cynicism. When you part ways, you feel tired.  

Most of us play both of these roles, depending on our moods.  Some of us fall almost constantly into one of the two buckets.

There is no reason we can’t all fall into the first category. 

Which one are you? Do you give or take energy from the people around you?
