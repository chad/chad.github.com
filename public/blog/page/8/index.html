  <div class="article-content"><p>We just wrapped up <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf 2008</a>.  A lot has been said about RailsConf elsewhere, so <br />
as the program chair I&#8217;ll just say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to the speakers, attendees, co-organizers, sponsors, and <br />
everyone else for making it the best conference I&#8217;ve ever been to.</p>
<p>A lot of exciting things happened.  Among the most exciting to me was the public unveiling of <br />
<a href="http://ruby.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  I&#8217;ve had a version of Maglev on my computer for about a month now, but <br />
I haven&#8217;t been able to talk about it. Now that it has been announced, most things I know are fair game.</p>
<p><a href="http://avibryant.com">Avi Bryant</a> and I met at the first RubyConf.  He&#8217;s been a fan and friend of Ruby ever <br />
since.  He happens to be doing mostly Smalltalk these days, but he&#8217;s been following the Ruby and (more <br />
recently) Rails communities closely.  After that first RubyConf, we reconnected while both attending <a href="http://dreamsongs.com">Dick <br />
Gabriel&#8217;s</a> pilot <span class="caps">MFA</span> in Software Development program at <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/"><span class="caps">UIUC</span></a> in <br />
early 2003.  Avi&#8217;s been talking since then about running Ruby on a Smalltalk VM.<br />
I&#8217;ve even started my own attempt once or twice, based on Avi&#8217;s ideas of how it could be done.</p>
<p>Given Avi&#8217;s interest in Ruby on Smalltalk and that he also created the mind-bending <br />
<a href="http://seaside.st">Seaside</a> web application framework, we invited him to keynote at last year&#8217;s RailsConf.  It was there, in his <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/#574286">message from the future</a> keynote, that he made public<br />
his belief that Ruby could benefit from being hosted on a mature, dynamic (Smalltalk) VM.</p>
<p>It was also, as I understand it, from that talk that <a href="http://gemstone.com">Gemstone</a> got the idea to run Rails.</p>
<p>The conversations started just after RailsConf last year, but it was only a few short months ago that Avi started work on <a href="http://maglev.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  That&#8217;s part of what makes it so amazing.  He and the<br />
engineers at Gemstone have gotten a huge subset of the Ruby language running on the Gemstone VM in just three months.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">RDBMS</span> R.I.P.</h1>
<p>Well, not really, but it&#8217;s fun to say.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about what Maglev promises.  By far the most interesting to me is <br />
Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s coolest about how Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine works within the context of Maglev is that it doesn&#8217;t<br />
feel like a persistence engine.  It&#8217;s just objects.  Everything&#8217;s just objects.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the average Rails application is a styled set of <span class="caps">CRUD</span> operations on top of an <br />
<em>object graph</em>.  That&#8217;s right, an object graph.  The fact that most Rails applications are backed<br />
by a relational database is a somewhat-necessary annoyance.</p>
<p>So in circumstances where you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>, why would you want to litter your pristine Ruby objects with <span class="caps">SQL</span> and other <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>-related work-arounds?  If it were possible to simply instantiate objects and not have to think about the underlying storage implementation at all, wouldn&#8217;t that be better?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Gemstone (and, therefore, Maglev) gives you.</p>
<p>There were questions during the demo about ActiveRecord compatibility.  To me, building in ActiveRecord <br />
compatibility is worse than a waste of time.  Sure, there are things in ActiveRecord which would be useful <br />
regardless of the storage mechanism.  Declarative relationships and validations are examples.  But, when <br />
you&#8217;re dealing with objects in memory, the idea of a :conditions clause with <span class="caps">SQL</span> in it is absolutely <br />
unnecessary and unappealing.</p>
<h1>Fast as hell</h1>
<p>Avi and the Gemstone people knew from their understanding of how the VM works that a Ruby implementation<br />
on Gemstone would be really fast.  They were right.  But as I said, the speed of the implementation is <br />
secondary to the persistence engine.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s really really fast.  On micro-benchmarks, it&#8217;s up to 100 times faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.</p>
<p>As has already been whined about ad nauseam, micro-benchmarks can be misleading.  They test very specific <br />
parts of the implementation and don&#8217;t always give you a picture of what real-world application performance <br />
will be like. So, let&#8217;s take this approach with the Maglev benchmarks: it&#8217;s fast enough.  It&#8217;s probably a<br />
lot faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.  And, we&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">MRI</span> for years for real applications.</p>
<p>Good enough.  Probably awesome.  But at least good enough.</p>
<p>Now is it going to slow down as they start implementing more of the libraries and language features? That&#8217;s<br />
the conventional wisdom.  I say <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>Smalltalk and Ruby are, as Avi has said numerous times, essentially the same language.  So the Gemstone VM<br />
has been tailor-made for running dynamic language code with closures, continuations, etc. and has been<br />
doing it for years.  Imagine the process, then, of converting Ruby to Smalltalk.  It&#8217;s in most cases<br />
a fairly straightforward language to language translation.</p>
<p>Where it <em>isn&#8217;t</em> as simple as that, Gemstone have a pretty big advantage:  they own the VM and they can <br />
change it to fit what Ruby needs.</p>
<p>I expect Maglev to get <em>faster</em> as the team starts to spend time on optimization.  So far, they&#8217;re in the<br />
&#8220;make it run&#8221; phase of the process.  Remember, three months in.</p>
<p>Antonio Cangiano <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/06/05/maglev-handles-trees-like-a-monkey/">also had a look at Maglev recently</a> and has a bit more to say about the specifics of Maglev performance</p>
<h1>Ruby Compliance (or &#8220;it runs WEBRick!&#8221;)</h1>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for Maglev?  As the Gemstone team has said, their next goal is to start running and passing<br />
the Ruby specs created by the other Ruby implementers.  They hadn&#8217;t prioritized this leading up to RailsConf,<br />
because, RailsConf being a web development conference, they wanted us all to see WEBRick running.</p>
<p>But, hey, they have WEBRick running!  Have you looked at the code for WEBRick?  That&#8217;s a lot of Ruby.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to a report on how well the Ruby specs run at this moment.  I think everyone will be<br />
pleasantly surprised.  And the specs will give the team a clear goal to work toward.</p>
<h1>So Will I Use This Thing?!</h1>
<p>When you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> (more often than you think) or you need scalable Ruby servers, I think<br />
Maglev is going to be an enticing alternative.  It&#8217;s not going to kill the other implementations.  Each<br />
implementation has its place. This isn&#8217;t a war, after all.</p>
<p>Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are for integration.  <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span> and Rubinius will compete for the &#8220;standard&#8221; use <br />
cases. Maglev is for big, distributed object stores inside of fast, scalable servers.  Think Rails, <br />
Adhearsion, or various coordination services running custom protocols on sockets.  Don&#8217;t run scripts in <br />
Maglev.  Don&#8217;t write desktop apps in Maglev.  Just use Maglev to serve tons of requests against billions of <br />
objects.</p>
<p>Maglev is good for the Ruby ecosystem just as <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span>, Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are good for the <br />
Ruby ecosystem.  The fact that we (will) have so many alternatives is a good thing.</p></div>

<p>By this time next year, we&#8217;ll see production deployments of Rubinius, with Rubinius quickly becoming the defacto standard Ruby implementation after that.  You won&#8217;t want to try to deploy your Rails application on it today, but it&#8217;s definitely time to give it a look if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>In my <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2008/3/27/great-ruby-code">previous post</a>, I asked for examples of great Ruby code.  I got emails, comments, instant messages, and twitter messages with suggestions.  I&#8217;d still like more.</p>
<p>But one really cool suggestion came from an idea <a href="http://fun3d.larc.nasa.gov/">Bil Kleb</a> and <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter Provost</a> had.  They proposed a <a href="http://hotornot.com">Hot or Not</a> -like site for code.</p>
<p>I thought that would be fun, so <a href="http://codefluency.com">Bruce</a> and I whipped something up in a couple of hours over the weekend:  <a href="http://slickorslack.com">Slick or Slack?</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/slickorslack.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not done yet, but we deployed it anyway.  My experience helping <a href="http://zefrank.com">Ze Frank</a> with <a href="http://colorwar2008.com">Color Wars 2008</a> has convinced me that deploying things that aren&#8217;t done is more often a good idea than not.  If for nothing else that for mental health reasons.</p>
<p>What we want to do now is to start collecting potentially &#8220;Slick&#8221; code snippets.  This could mean beautiful code, clever code, code which does something awesome, or whatever.  You can also post code that sucks.  We just need code to start the tallies running.</p>
<p>When you visit the site, you&#8217;ll be presented with two code samples, probably doing totally different things.  They might even be in different languages.  Your job is to choose the better of the two.  If you can&#8217;t make up your mind, just hit refresh.</p>
<p>I doubt this is going to unearth great code in the same way that I doubt Hot or Not unearths great people.  But I hope it will be fun to play with.  It will probably be broken and we know it&#8217;s lacking some necessary features to make it more useful and/or fun.  Suggestions are welcome.  Just don&#8217;t take it too seriously.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Tonight, <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich</a>, <a href="http://project.ioni.st">Marcel</a> and I spoke at the <a href="http://www.dcrug.org/">DC Ruby Users Group</a>.  Instead of choosing a topic, preparing a set of slides, and droning on about something for an hour we decided to involve the group to help us answer a question.  It&#8217;s a question I get a lot when I do training with <a href="http://www.pragmaticstudio.com">The Pragmatic Studio</a>:  &#8220;Which Ruby projects should I look at to see examples of great Ruby code?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have my standard answers (I&#8217;m sure we all do), but two things occur to me about answering such a question.  The first is that when asked a question like this, I have a gut reaction.  There are names that spring immediately to mind.  If I scrutinize these reflex reactions I realize that I haven&#8217;t <em>really</em> examined the code I&#8217;m thinking of in enough detail to call it <em>great</em>.  So though I have some cursory knowledge that makes me pretty sure when I give my recommendations (I&#8217;m holding off on naming specifics so as to not influence <em>your</em> answer to this question), I&#8217;m not 100% sure which projects contain <em>great</em> Ruby code.</p>
<p>The second realization about this is that some of the names that spring to mind are based on potentially the wrong criteria.  I, like all humans, am more likely to mention something popular than something obscure.  There is also a Ruby community folklore.  Some names are synonymous with &#8220;great&#8221;.  But it&#8217;s just folklore.  So the knee-jerk reactions are at risk of being heavily influenced by the Ruby popular culture.  Looking at how successful popular culture is at picking great music, visual art, fiction, and other artistic mediums, it&#8217;s pretty clear that we shouldn&#8217;t trust pop culture when making decisions about which projects are composed of &#8220;great&#8221; code.</p>
<p>So we asked the DC <span class="caps">RUG</span>: &#8220;Who are the greatest Ruby programmers in the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, all together, we looked at code written by the people they came up with.</p>
<p>Some of it was beautiful.  Some of it was ugly.</p>
<p>We talked about what made some of it beautiful and some of it ugly.  We talked about the importance of writing beautiful code.  It was fun.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still don&#8217;t have a satisfactory list of <em>great</em> Ruby code.  I&#8217;d like to build such a list.  So, please leave a comment saying the name of an open source Ruby project you feel represents truly great Ruby code.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p><i>I&#8217;m always looking for ways to get humans together for meaningful (potentially lasting) interactions at our conferences.  So we&#8217;re trying something new this year during the tutorial day.  It happens on the first (or 0th?) day of the conference on purpose: so the work can continue for the rest of the conference.  My hope is to bring project owners/committers together with aspiring contributors and bring more people into the fold of projects which need help.  Think of it as a room full of code sprints happening all at once.  Here&#8217;s the description:</i></p>
<p><ins>Project Owners</ins>: Do you have a project you&#8217;d like to work with other people on?  Maybe it&#8217;s an established Open Source project.  Maybe it&#8217;s a new idea.  Come find like-minded developers and spend the day hacking together.</p>
<p><ins>Developers</ins>: Are you looking to get involved in an Open Source project but need a bootstrapping session to get you started?  Looking for chances to meet other developers and establish collaborative working relationships? Looking to learn by collaborating with others?  Come find a project and spend the day sitting side-by-side with one or more of its developers learning the ropes and contributing code.</p>
<p><a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> is the largest physical gathering of Ruby and Rails developers internationally.  Let&#8217;s take advantage of all being in one place at the same time <span class="caps">AND</span> take the chance to give something back to the projects and community which we so greatly benefit from.</p>
<p>In the morning, project leaders and representatives will have a chance to make a short pitch for their projects and the work they hope to get done.  For the rest of the day, groups will self-organize and write code!  Roll up your sleeves and prepare to learn, teach, and most importantly, contribute.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/railsconf2008/index.cgi?CommunityProjectCodeDrive">this page</a> and add your project or idea to the list of projects likely to be active in the Code Drive.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;m out in not-so-sunny Cupertino, CA with <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/">Dave</a> teaching an introduction to Ruby course for a big company this week.  Though I&#8217;d always rather be back home with Kelly, we&#8217;re having a great time out here.  In addition to a lovely dinner with <a href="http://chopine.be/lrz/diary/">Laurent</a>, <a href="http://people.freebsd.org/~jkh/">Jordan</a>, and Luke from Apple last night, I&#8217;ve been having a blast introducing a 15-person group to Ruby for the first time.</p>
<p>I do a lot of advanced level courses and Rails courses, but this one is rewarding in a different way:  I&#8217;m reminded of how absolutely <em>beautiful</em> the Ruby language is.  When you use a language every day it&#8217;s easy to forget the things about it that originally roped you in.  I&#8217;m finding this experience to be an excellent way to relive that through the delighted looks on the faces of the students in this class.</p>
<p>Dave and I are doing this course together for the Pragmatic Studio <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby-intro/">later this month in Denver</a>.  If you or someone you know have been meaning to dig into Ruby, I invite you to come share the joy with us</p></div>

<p>Scanning through the videos this morning, I was reminded of what a great time I had at RailsConf.  Planning is well underway for RailsConf 2008 (keep your eyes peeled for registration to open soon).  An initial batch of proposals have been selected, and I&#8217;m already excited about the program this year.</p>
<p>The Rails community is maturing, and the level of proposed content has matured along with it.  Expect more advanced content this year from a more experienced (obviously) group of practitioners.</p>
<p>Seeya there!</p></div>
