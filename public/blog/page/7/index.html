  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf registration is open</a>, and I am so excited by the program this year that I thought it would be fun to ask some of the speakers some questions before the conference. So I&#8217;m starting a series of informal interviews with RubyConf speakers.</p>
<p>The first one is <a href="http://www.urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens/">Greg Borenstein</a>, creator of <a href="http://rad.rubyforge.org/"><span class="caps">RAD</span></a>.  Greg also ran the lightning talks at <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf 2008</a>.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;re working on <span class="caps">RAD</span> (Ruby Arduino Development).  How did you get into electronics in the first place?  I&#8217;ve never had training myself and always been interested but intimidated.  Was it hard?</h2>
<p>I had electronics twice, in high school and again in college, as part of general physics classes. I was incredibly bored by the subject and quite bad at it both times. Neither of those experiences had much in the way of hands-on tinkering time. Instead, they were electronics as Science: dry equations, proofs, and word problems, and I never absorbed much of it.</p>
<p>In college I majored in art and wrote my thesis in art history, but what I was really trying to study was how to make things. I&#8217;d met there, for the first time, people who were budding engineers and I kind of got infected by their mindset: the constant pull to understand how things worked, not necessarily to reveal the grand truths of the universe, but just to dive beneath the surface of things to learn how they operated enough to change them and make them your own and make new ones. I took classes in painting, printmaking, music theory, book making, anything that I thought would teach me how to build something new &#8212; even my run of math classes and my written thesis, I approached as varieties of making. A group of us got money from the school to try to build our own atomic force microscope. We got pretty far designing and constructing it, finally running out of school year while still hung up on the control software.</p>
<p>Also, the summer before my senior year, I interned at the Museum of Jurassic Technology (<a href="http://mjt.org">http://mjt.org</a>). The Museum is like a cross between an pre-renaissance cabinet of curiosities, a contemporary art installation, and a Disneyland ride. It&#8217;s filled with amazing exhibits that move and buzz and talk and glow; exhibits on micro-miniature sculpture, folk cures, Athanasius Kircher, Soviet cosmonaut dogs, Innuit string art, stereographic x-rays of flowers, etc. The museum&#8217;s founder, David Wilson, used to work in optical effects in Hollywood and is this genius of museum craft: optics, dioramas, lighting, etc. The summer I was there, there was an intern from the Getty cleaning the exhibits so their insides were open, relays and gears, projectors and wires, all spilling out.</p>
<p>All through this, I&#8217;d say I didn&#8217;t really know electronics and, mostly, I still don&#8217;t. These experiences, rather than teaching me much of practical use about electronics really just served to infect me with the bug to learn more. They showed me that electronics could be more than dry Science, it could be magic and it could be a key into how things really worked. Magic that you could make.</p>
<p>After college I wound my way through a series of professions and avocations and eventually wound up in programming. After awhile, the Arduino came along. I started to hear about it from mostly media-oriented friends as something they wanted to get into. Eventually, a group of us got together, ordered a handful of them from Sparkfun and set out to meet once a week to try to teach ourselves to use them. We were very quickly confronted with the fact that we barely knew any electronics. Getting a resistor on the right side of an <span class="caps">LED</span> to do the classic Arduino hello world was a challenged for us.</p>
<p>So, I started digging through my old physics textbooks and looking for new ones that were better. We&#8217;d set ourselves little projects like playing a melody on a tiny speaker or checking for a pattern on a series of buttons. For the first time, I was learning electronics the way I learned printmaking and Ruby: out of the need to see something I was making actually work.</p>
<p>Finally, the last few years, I&#8217;ve been really making progress, but it&#8217;s a challenge because the resources are really amazingly poor. Compared with the tools available for learning programming languages (from books to blogs to users&#8217; groups), the hardware story is just brutally bad in this regard for beginners. All the documentation is tied up in data sheets from hardware vendors meant to be used by professional electrical engineers to design projects for mass production. Most of the tutorials, magazines, and books meant for regular people are based around one-off projects that, even if you do gather all the resources together to actually build, will teach you little about the actual underlying principles that you could actually grasp or re-use.</p>
<p>My most successful strategy has usually been getting my hands on real people that actual know this stuff and just asking stupid questions repeatedly until they actually give me an answer that starts at the beginning. That plus a few amazing books (that I&#8217;ve been beginning to catalog here: <a href="http://github.com/atduskgreg/rad/wikis/books">http://github.com/atduskgreg/rad/wikis/books</a>) has really been all that&#8217;s helped.</p>
<h2>Can you explain architecturally how <span class="caps">RAD</span> works? How do you get Ruby code to &#8220;compile&#8221; to code that can run on an Arduino microprocessor?</h2>
<p><span class="caps">RAD</span> works by translating some Ruby code into C which can then be linked against the full Arduino software library and handed off to avr-gcc for compilation down into the hex that can be uploaded to an Arduino. The Arduino software library is built around two main functions: setup and loop; setup runs once when the Arduino starts up and after that, loop runs repeatedly. <span class="caps">RAD</span> takes a different translation strategy for each of these.</p>
<p>For setup, <span class="caps">RAD</span> provides a base class ArduinoSketch. Much like Rails&#8217; ActiveRecord::Base, classes that inherit from ArduinoSketch gain a bunch of class methods for doing a lot of the configuration and setup necessary for programming the Arduino: declaring pins as input or output, setting up helpers for working with various pieces of hardware such as LCDs and Servos, etc.. <span class="caps">RAD</span> uses some metaprogramming magic and some seriously lo-fi string concatenation to use these class methods that you call in your sketch to generate a big chunk of C code: a lot of function signatures, library includes, and other boilerplate as well as the setup function itself</p>
<p>Now, the loop function is another story. <span class="caps">RAD</span> looks for a method on your subclass of ArduinoSketch called loop. It takes that method and hands it off to a library called RubyToC, which spits back the C equivalent. RubyToC was written by Ryan Davis and Eric Hodel and probably some of the other Seattle.rb geniuses as part of the Metaruby Project whose goal was to rewrite Ruby entirely in Ruby. I think that project might be some form of dead at this point since all of those guys now work for Engine Yard on Rubinius. Anyway, from RAD&#8217;s point of view, RubyToC is mostly magic alien technology that does exactly what we need (though we have made our own extensions by subclassing some pieces of the RubyToC machinery in order to implement some additional features (such as times blocks) in ways that might not be satisfactory for the general project of converting Ruby to C, but work great for us with our constrained compiler targeting).</p>
<p>We do the same thing with any other additional helper methods you&#8217;ve written on your class, glue the whole thing together and send it off for compilation.</p>
<p>The Arduino is obviously highly resource constrained (it only has 16k of flash program memory) and so a lot of people ask about the bloat that&#8217;s caused by the inefficient C we generate. We work had to keep that down (I can&#8217;t find the current stat for it, but I&#8217;ll get back to you with that) and I think that it&#8217;s worth it for the great increase in ease of use that Ruby provides over C++.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the coolest thing you&#8217;ve done or seen done with <span class="caps">RAD</span>?</h2>
<p>Right now, the answer to that is probably one of JD Barnhart&#8217;s recent projects. Either his Ruby on Bells:</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/1261369">http://vimeo.com/1261369</a></p>
<p>or his Ruby + Auduino Midi Beat Box Demo:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1650051">http://www.vimeo.com/1650051</a></p>
<p>JD came along like manna from open source heaven this summer: I hadn&#8217;t had much time to work on <span class="caps">RAD</span> for awhile and had accumulated a laundry list of requested features, both my own and from other users. As soon as I put <span class="caps">RAD</span> up on GitHub, JD forked it and added nearly all of them. He announced his work by putting a great screencast up with that Bells demo and a tour of his improvements. He makes great screencasts! I&#8217;ve since brought him on as part of the <span class="caps">RAD</span> core team and he has, along with Bryan Riley from wulfden.org, been a big part of the fast rate of improvement RAD&#8217;s been seeing lately.</p>
<h2>Where do you see yourself taking <span class="caps">RAD</span> next?</h2>
<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in the middle of doing a few desperately needed refactorings on the <span class="caps">RAD</span> code base, mostly consolidating things so we can clean up some of the fallout of all the recent improvements and make things more flexible and easier to improve.</p>
<p>After that I have two main directions I want to take the project: the educational route and the &#8216;modern software tools&#8217; route.</p>
<p>I mentioned in response to you first question how much Arduino helped make it possible for me to learn electronics in the first place by giving me a fun environment where I could experiment and build things rapidly and easily. The whole purpose of <span class="caps">RAD</span> is to take this project even further: to let you program the Arduino in Ruby instead of C because it&#8217;s even faster and more fun. I think <span class="caps">RAD</span> can be a great tool for lowering the barrier to learning hardware hacking. Ruby&#8217;s expressiveness makes <span class="caps">RAD</span> code examples extremely readable. I&#8217;m trying to foster a culture around <span class="caps">RAD</span> of really good documentation: not just of <span class="caps">RAD</span> itself, but of exactly the hardware that is usually only explained through arcane data sheets. The <span class="caps">RAD</span> wiki is already starting to house some good material like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/atduskgreg/rad/wikis">http://github.com/atduskgreg/rad/wikis</a></p>
<p>and I&#8217;m hoping to see (and write) more and more as the project progresses. Just as some of the great books that helped me learn Ruby (the Pickaxe book, _why&#8217;s Poignant Guide, Chris Pine&#8217;s Learn to Program) also taught me the basics of good programming itself, I&#8217;m hoping that <span class="caps">RAD</span> can be an entry point into creating some documentation for the wider world of hardware hacking.</p>
<p>The other big direction I want to take the project is to build all the &#8216;modern software tools&#8217;: we&#8217;ve become used to in Rubyland, but are still extreme luxuries in embedded C++ such as testing, simulation, code stats, etc. One of the great things about having written a program for your Arduino in Ruby instead of C++ is that once you&#8217;ve done so, we can use Ruby&#8217;s metaprogamming power to interpret that program in different contexts to accomplish different goals. So, just through writing a different implementation of ArduinoSketch, we can run your sketch in a test framework that will help you make sure that it actually does what you want it to or in a graphical simulator that lets you play with different hardware connections and code combinations to see what will happen before having to actually build out circuits or connect your real Arduino at all. Both of these projects (the testing framework and the simulation app) are in extremely nascent stages right now, but I hope to pour more time into them as soon as we finish up our current refactor.</p>
<h2>What are you passionate about outside of computer programming and electronics?</h2>
<p>Music has been a passion for me for a long time. I play in an indie rock band called At Dusk (<a href="http://atduskmusic.com">http://atduskmusic.com</a>) that&#8217;s been together for almost 10 years. We&#8217;ve toured around the country and put out 3 albums (with a fourth and final one on the way). I also run a local Portland music non-profit called <span class="caps">PDX</span> Pop Now! that puts on a free local all-ages music festival every year, produces an annual compilation of all local music, and helps do advocacy for kids&#8217; access to music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also passionate about art &#8212; I think part of my energy for electronics comes from surplus created from drawing less the last couple of years. Artists like Jennifer and Kevin McCoy (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mccoyspace/">http://flickr.com/photos/mccoyspace/</a>), Joseph Cornell, Thomas Demand (<a href="http://www.thomasdemand.de/">http://www.thomasdemand.de/</a>), Chandra Bocci, and David Hockney, et al inspire my interest in physical computing stuff as much as anything on the technical side does.</p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;ve discovered a passion for cooking. I&#8217;ve been working from Alice Waters&#8217; books which are all about simple preparations of the best seasonal local produce so that&#8217;s lead me to start learning about gardening as well. That, combined with my adoption of biking as my main form of transportation starting a few months back, as made me feel like I&#8217;ve finally become the typical northwesterner, which must mean that it&#8217;s time to shake things up!</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://sersylvester.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/bilateral-all-the-thing-studios-this-dive/">This spam post</a> reminded me that I haven&#8217;t reminded you that the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/">Rails Studio</a> is coming soon here in Denver. It&#8217;s happening in September, but early registration ends <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>This is my first time teaching the public Rails Studio with Dave. We do Advanced Ruby and Ruby Studio, and Advanced Rails together. I got to sit in on a Rails Studio he and Mike did together last year in Seattle and had a great time. It&#8217;s really fun watching people experience the &#8220;aha&#8221; moments for the first time. Reminds you of how you felt the first time you watched the 15 minute intro video.</p>
<p>Apart from all the fun of learning a great framework for the first time, Colorado is a really nice place to be in September. So if you are coming, try to plan a couple of days before or after (I&#8217;d say after&#8230;.let your mind unwind after a few days of hard thinking and head up to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/romo/">Rocky Mountain National Park</a> for the weekend.</p>
<p>The spam post I linked above put it best, I think:</p>
Self’ll broaden the mind he how on route to amplify tall idea-experienced programs.
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to amplifying tall idea-experienced programs.  And teaching Rails.</p></div>

<p>What was also fun about this one was that when he asked to interview me, he didn&#8217;t have a specific topic in mind. So it ended up being about nothing and everything. Kinda like Seinfeld but unfortunately not as funny.</p>
<p>Since I haven&#8217;t been posting here a lot lately, the podcast is a good place to find out what I&#8217;m up to, which includes <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> hacking and writing a computer game which interfaces with my exercise bike.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to write a travel book. Today I get the sensation of having written one without having to go to the effort.</p>
<p>But seriously, it&#8217;s been fun to watch the reaction on Slashdot, well known for its high level of discourse. Sadly, everyone except the reviewer (thanks Josh!) is caught up in the India part. My fault, I know. It&#8217;s not really about India or outsourcing. It&#8217;s about building a remarkable career.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about trying not to lose.  It&#8217;s about trying to win.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Much of what we do in software development is focused on residual artifacts of the process.  But software development is itself a process, and the best development happens not when programmers are keying in the code to implement a design but when great programmers are improvising within constraints and iterating toward a goal.</p>
<p>Programming is something you do (as opposed to something that is just <em>done</em>).  Why isn&#8217;t there much focus on programming as a performance activity?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard interesting tales of programmers performing on stage either during conference presentations (the developer of Ruby Cocoa at Ruby Kaigi last year) or driving live computer-music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see more examples.  Anyone have any to link?</p></div>

<p>We&#8217;re at <a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/RubyKaigi2008/">Ruby Kaigi 2008</a> and having a great time.  Yesterday <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich</a> and I did a panel discussion with <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html">Masayoshi Takahashi</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Matz</a> on the history of Ruby communities and business outside of Japan.</p>
<p>Today the main conference starts with presentations by Koichi, Charlie, and Evan on <span class="caps">YARV</span>, JRuby, and Rubinius respectively.  It&#8217;s shaping up to be an excellent conference.  More later.</p>
<p>The one thing that strikes me so far is that it&#8217;s much easier to get here and participate than I thought it would be.  If you&#8217;ve considered coming to Ruby Kaigi and have never been to Japan, I highly recommend it.  Tokyo is easy to get around even without speaking Japanese and the trip wasn&#8217;t as harrowing as I expected.  Hopefully next year we&#8217;ll see the non-Japanese contingent grow and the language barriers blur a little more.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>We just wrapped up <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf 2008</a>.  A lot has been said about RailsConf elsewhere, so <br />
as the program chair I&#8217;ll just say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to the speakers, attendees, co-organizers, sponsors, and <br />
everyone else for making it the best conference I&#8217;ve ever been to.</p>
<p>A lot of exciting things happened.  Among the most exciting to me was the public unveiling of <br />
<a href="http://ruby.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  I&#8217;ve had a version of Maglev on my computer for about a month now, but <br />
I haven&#8217;t been able to talk about it. Now that it has been announced, most things I know are fair game.</p>
<p><a href="http://avibryant.com">Avi Bryant</a> and I met at the first RubyConf.  He&#8217;s been a fan and friend of Ruby ever <br />
since.  He happens to be doing mostly Smalltalk these days, but he&#8217;s been following the Ruby and (more <br />
recently) Rails communities closely.  After that first RubyConf, we reconnected while both attending <a href="http://dreamsongs.com">Dick <br />
Gabriel&#8217;s</a> pilot <span class="caps">MFA</span> in Software Development program at <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/"><span class="caps">UIUC</span></a> in <br />
early 2003.  Avi&#8217;s been talking since then about running Ruby on a Smalltalk VM.<br />
I&#8217;ve even started my own attempt once or twice, based on Avi&#8217;s ideas of how it could be done.</p>
<p>Given Avi&#8217;s interest in Ruby on Smalltalk and that he also created the mind-bending <br />
<a href="http://seaside.st">Seaside</a> web application framework, we invited him to keynote at last year&#8217;s RailsConf.  It was there, in his <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/#574286">message from the future</a> keynote, that he made public<br />
his belief that Ruby could benefit from being hosted on a mature, dynamic (Smalltalk) VM.</p>
<p>It was also, as I understand it, from that talk that <a href="http://gemstone.com">Gemstone</a> got the idea to run Rails.</p>
<p>The conversations started just after RailsConf last year, but it was only a few short months ago that Avi started work on <a href="http://maglev.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  That&#8217;s part of what makes it so amazing.  He and the<br />
engineers at Gemstone have gotten a huge subset of the Ruby language running on the Gemstone VM in just three months.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">RDBMS</span> R.I.P.</h1>
<p>Well, not really, but it&#8217;s fun to say.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about what Maglev promises.  By far the most interesting to me is <br />
Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s coolest about how Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine works within the context of Maglev is that it doesn&#8217;t<br />
feel like a persistence engine.  It&#8217;s just objects.  Everything&#8217;s just objects.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the average Rails application is a styled set of <span class="caps">CRUD</span> operations on top of an <br />
<em>object graph</em>.  That&#8217;s right, an object graph.  The fact that most Rails applications are backed<br />
by a relational database is a somewhat-necessary annoyance.</p>
<p>So in circumstances where you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>, why would you want to litter your pristine Ruby objects with <span class="caps">SQL</span> and other <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>-related work-arounds?  If it were possible to simply instantiate objects and not have to think about the underlying storage implementation at all, wouldn&#8217;t that be better?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Gemstone (and, therefore, Maglev) gives you.</p>
<p>There were questions during the demo about ActiveRecord compatibility.  To me, building in ActiveRecord <br />
compatibility is worse than a waste of time.  Sure, there are things in ActiveRecord which would be useful <br />
regardless of the storage mechanism.  Declarative relationships and validations are examples.  But, when <br />
you&#8217;re dealing with objects in memory, the idea of a :conditions clause with <span class="caps">SQL</span> in it is absolutely <br />
unnecessary and unappealing.</p>
<h1>Fast as hell</h1>
<p>Avi and the Gemstone people knew from their understanding of how the VM works that a Ruby implementation<br />
on Gemstone would be really fast.  They were right.  But as I said, the speed of the implementation is <br />
secondary to the persistence engine.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s really really fast.  On micro-benchmarks, it&#8217;s up to 100 times faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.</p>
<p>As has already been whined about ad nauseam, micro-benchmarks can be misleading.  They test very specific <br />
parts of the implementation and don&#8217;t always give you a picture of what real-world application performance <br />
will be like. So, let&#8217;s take this approach with the Maglev benchmarks: it&#8217;s fast enough.  It&#8217;s probably a<br />
lot faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.  And, we&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">MRI</span> for years for real applications.</p>
<p>Good enough.  Probably awesome.  But at least good enough.</p>
<p>Now is it going to slow down as they start implementing more of the libraries and language features? That&#8217;s<br />
the conventional wisdom.  I say <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>Smalltalk and Ruby are, as Avi has said numerous times, essentially the same language.  So the Gemstone VM<br />
has been tailor-made for running dynamic language code with closures, continuations, etc. and has been<br />
doing it for years.  Imagine the process, then, of converting Ruby to Smalltalk.  It&#8217;s in most cases<br />
a fairly straightforward language to language translation.</p>
<p>Where it <em>isn&#8217;t</em> as simple as that, Gemstone have a pretty big advantage:  they own the VM and they can <br />
change it to fit what Ruby needs.</p>
<p>I expect Maglev to get <em>faster</em> as the team starts to spend time on optimization.  So far, they&#8217;re in the<br />
&#8220;make it run&#8221; phase of the process.  Remember, three months in.</p>
<p>Antonio Cangiano <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/06/05/maglev-handles-trees-like-a-monkey/">also had a look at Maglev recently</a> and has a bit more to say about the specifics of Maglev performance</p>
<h1>Ruby Compliance (or &#8220;it runs WEBRick!&#8221;)</h1>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for Maglev?  As the Gemstone team has said, their next goal is to start running and passing<br />
the Ruby specs created by the other Ruby implementers.  They hadn&#8217;t prioritized this leading up to RailsConf,<br />
because, RailsConf being a web development conference, they wanted us all to see WEBRick running.</p>
<p>But, hey, they have WEBRick running!  Have you looked at the code for WEBRick?  That&#8217;s a lot of Ruby.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to a report on how well the Ruby specs run at this moment.  I think everyone will be<br />
pleasantly surprised.  And the specs will give the team a clear goal to work toward.</p>
<h1>So Will I Use This Thing?!</h1>
<p>When you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> (more often than you think) or you need scalable Ruby servers, I think<br />
Maglev is going to be an enticing alternative.  It&#8217;s not going to kill the other implementations.  Each<br />
implementation has its place. This isn&#8217;t a war, after all.</p>
<p>Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are for integration.  <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span> and Rubinius will compete for the &#8220;standard&#8221; use <br />
cases. Maglev is for big, distributed object stores inside of fast, scalable servers.  Think Rails, <br />
Adhearsion, or various coordination services running custom protocols on sockets.  Don&#8217;t run scripts in <br />
Maglev.  Don&#8217;t write desktop apps in Maglev.  Just use Maglev to serve tons of requests against billions of <br />
objects.</p>
<p>Maglev is good for the Ruby ecosystem just as <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span>, Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are good for the <br />
Ruby ecosystem.  The fact that we (will) have so many alternatives is a good thing.</p></div>
