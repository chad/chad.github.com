    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a person I want to work with. I can&#8217;t find this person. I&#8217;ve literally searched the world,
and I can hardly find a trace.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not talking about someone specific. In fact, that&#8217;s the problem.  I&#8217;m talking about a set of traits
and an attitude which is more scarce than I realized until recently.  I know a small handful of people who
fit what I&#8217;m looking for, but they&#8217;re busy and unavailable right now.</p>

<p>I was talking to one of these people recently about my desire to, as I put it, &#8220;hire someone like you&#8221;, and we
both realized how hard it is to name really <em>anyone</em> <em>else</em> who fits the description. Given this and the fact that
there are so many <em>bad</em> job descriptions for developers in the world, I&#8217;m writing down what I&#8217;m looking for
in hopes that this person (you?) is out there:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone knows that when you take on a task whether it&#8217;s huge and scary or tiny and boring, you&#8217;re going to see it through to the best of your ability.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s <em>obvious</em> to everyone around you that you have fun with your work and with your co-workers.</li>
<li>You care about how your work and attitude affects those around you. I mean <em>really</em> care. If you hurt someone, it hurts you. Everything you do runs through this filter.</li>
<li>You understand that communication is the <em>biggest</em> responsibility of your job as a developer and the one you&#8217;re least likely to get right unless you focus on it.</li>
<li>You focus on shipping software that matters to your users and that matters to the company you&#8217;re building it for.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve experimented with and survived many different types of development and project methodologies, which has left you with a healthy appreciation for what works from the so-called &#8220;agile&#8221; methodologies and those that came before (and after) them.</li>
<li>You have no time for ceremony. Maybe you even hate it, but &#8220;hate&#8221; is too dogmatic a term.</li>
<li>You are humble enough to bend to the will of the frameworks, technologies, constraints, and <em>people</em> aren&#8217;t you when doing so won&#8217;t have a materially negative impact. In other words, you can play by someone else&#8217;s rules when that&#8217;s the easiest and/or best thing to do.</li>
<li>You make pragmatic (often boring) technology choices at work and you play in your free time. You don&#8217;t build science projects just because you are smart enough to build them.</li>
<li>You are confident enough that you don&#8217;t have to prove to anyone what a great developer you are, and therefore&#8230;</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t mind being the one that looks bad when you deserve it. You make mistakes sometimes, because you&#8217;re human, but rather than dwell on them you choose to fix and then learn from them.</li>
<li>You love to teach and learn from your co-workers.</li>
<li>You are confident with a number of programming languages, operating systems, and architectures. You probably have one of each you prefer right now, but you&#8217;re neither dogmatic nor myopic in your focus on it.</li>
</ul>


<p>From my perspective, these are the things that matter.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re the smartest person I&#8217;ve ever met.
I don&#8217;t care if you know everything about the technologies I&#8217;m deploying.
I don&#8217;t want a &#8220;rock star&#8221;. I definitely don&#8217;t want a ninja.
I don&#8217;t care if you write books, contribute to Open Source software, or speak at conferences. I do those things, and I know how little they predict how well I do my job.</p>

<p>If this describes you, I definitely want to know you. If you are interested in building scalable APIs and automated infrastructures for those APIs and would like to work with me in Berlin making beautiful productivity software, I <em>definitely</em> want to know you. Please get in touch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I keep learning this lesson over and over again, so I&#8217;m writing it here in an effort to never forget again. As a manager, if some task constantly stresses me out or makes me feel uneasy,
it&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m doing someone else&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean someone&#8217;s being lazy and I&#8217;m picking up their slack. I&#8217;m talking about those nagging little annoying things you find yourself doing as infrequently as you can
and do a half-assed job at every time. So you not only stress because they&#8217;re in the way of your <i>real</i> work but you stress because you suck at them.</p>

<p>Every time I allow myself to notice this feeling&#8211;every time I  analyze what&#8217;s causing it, it&#8217;s because I should be delegating this work to someone else. Usually, in a
mature organization, it&#8217;s even obvious <i>who</i> the work should go to.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about being a manager of people is that your core job includes uncluttering your and everyone else&#8217;s work days by putting the work, moving tasks to a home  where they can be
lovingly completed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned recently, <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2013/01/08/moving-to-berlin-and-auf-wiedersehen-to-friends/">we&#8217;ve moved to Berlin!</a>.  We got to spend a week of down time exploring the city.  We are definitely in love with Berlin so far!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited today to finally announce that I&#8217;ve joined <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/blog/willkommen-chad">6Wunderkinder</a> as CTO. In case you don&#8217;t know them by the company name, 6Wunderkinder are the creators of the extremely popular <a href="http://www.wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a>, which is a cross-platform, simple, and beautiful productivity application.  I&#8217;m a user, and as I&#8217;ve told friends and family about my move, I&#8217;ve discovered that many of you are too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/02/former-svp-chad-fowler-on-the-state-of.html">As I&#8217;ve said previously,</a>, I&#8217;ll miss my LivingSocial team and look forward to watching them from here in Berlin, but I&#8217;m extremely excited to get back to hands-on software development with the small, focused, team of brilliant product engineers here at 6Wunderkinder.</p>

<p>For those in the Berlin tech scene, if you happen to see me around at <a href="http://www.sanktoberholz.de/">Sankt Oberholz</a>, please do stop by and say hi :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="http://lynn.io/">Lynn Wallenstein</a>, I have a new web site design. If you see problems with the layout, it&#8217;s almost definitely because I screwed something up after Lynn gave me the code. Sorry, Lynn. :(</p>

<p>I have also used this as a chance to move from my own server (which I&#8217;ve been screwing with for over a decade) to Octopress hosted on Github Pages. I&#8217;m glad to be done with that phase of my life.</p>

<p>Anyway, with Octopress I feel like I&#8217;m stepping back to the simple, productive environment I had ten years ago with <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rublog/">Rublog</a>.</p>

    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2013/01/08/moving-to-berlin-and-auf-wiedersehen-to-friends</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/14/livingsocial-gains-wealth-of-ruby-on-rails-expertise-with-infoether-acquisition/">almost two years</a> since InfoEther was acquired by LivingSocial. Since then, we&#8217;ve built the strongest development team I&#8217;ve ever known. We&#8217;ve set <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/09/06/livingsocial-starbucks-record/">records</a> for e-commerce transaction volume. We&#8217;ve grown at an incredible pace, both as a business and as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=14sUms68LwA">technology team</a>. We&#8217;ve shipped a lot of software, and made millions of people&#8217;s lives more interesting in the process.  I&#8217;ve had the privilege to work with <a href="https://coderwall.com/team/livingsocial">some of the most admired engineers in on industry</a>. I&#8217;m proud of the team <a href="http://aaronbatalion.com/">Aaron Batalion</a> (from whom I&#8217;ve learned a ton about running a consumer internet product) had assembled before InfoEther arrived and of the team that ultimately grew from that foundation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/2011/12/21/re-thinking-software-development-education">As I mentioned when I announced</a> our <a href="http://hungryacademy.com">Hungry Academy program</a>, for me personally the experience at LivingSocial has been intense. As I said in that post, “These last 8 months at LivingSocial have been the best 4 years of my career.” That holds true today.</p>
<p>Playing the role of Senior Vice President of Technology and serving on the senior executive team at LivingSocial has been a rewarding learning experience.  I&#8217;m humbled by the talent and experience of every member of that team, and since my first day have been awed by <a href="http://corporate.livingsocial.com/ourteam">Tim O&#8217;Shaughnessy&#8217;s</a> business sense and natural leadership ability.  I look back on my career, and a handful of teachers and mentors stand out that have had a significant impact on me. Tim is now in that very short list.</p>
<p>All the while, though, I&#8217;ve known that I would eventually go back to a more hands-on role, personally building products and solving technical problems. I am, after all, a <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Passionate Programmer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/kellyjeanne">Kelly </a> and I have also had  a goal to (before we get too old to fully enjoy it) live overseas again.  Our time in India, <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/mjwti/my-job-went-to-india">was a huge influence on both of us, both personally and professionally</a>, and we&#8217;ve long since hoped to gain a similar experience in a different part of the world, specifically Europe.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do.  I&#8217;m taking a role as <span class="caps">CTO</span> of a technology startup in one of our favorite cities: Berlin.  I&#8217;ll be working hands-on to develop cross-platform software with a small, talented team of engineers, designers, and product managers. I&#8217;ll be transitioning from my role at LivingSocial for the remainder of January and will be relocated to Berlin and starting the new job in mid February.</p>
<p>As excited as I am to move to the next adventure, it&#8217;s always sad leaving a great company like LivingSocial.  I&#8217;ve made some friendships that will last forever, and I&#8217;ll miss the team immensely. I know, however, that they&#8217;re in good hands and that 2013 is going to be a fantastic year for the business. </p>]]></content>

    <updated>2011-12-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/12/27/the-art-craft-commodity-continuum</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you create art, the purpose is self-expression.</p>
<p>When you create software, the purpose is rarely self-expression.</p>
<p>When you create software, someone somewhere wants it to perform a set of functions and has a stake in how well those functions are implemented. The definition of &#8220;well&#8221; is up to the stakeholder.</p>
<p>When you create art, you want it to be beautiful, or beautifully ugly, or ornate, or plain. You, the creator, are the stakeholder. You may hope that others find it beautiful, but if they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s art&#8212;who&#8217;s to say what&#8217;s good and bad?</p>
<p>When you attempt to judge the quality of a commodity good solely in terms of its aesthetic appeal, you ignore the objective evaluation of how well that product meets the needs of its stakeholders.</p>
<p>When you attempt to judge the quality of a piece of art solely on some objective measure, you miss the point of the object as an expression of art.</p>
<p>Craft falls somewhere between commodity and art. Craft items have both subjective, aesthetic appeal and objective function.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful Christian Dior dress:</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/falf/dior.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Beautiful but largely impractical.  Try to wear this on the subway or even in your car. Try to fit it through a standard door. It&#8217;s a beautiful piece of art, but it fails as a useful article of clothing for most people.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://paulsmith.co.uk">Paul Smith</a> suit. It&#8217;s practical, extremely well made, creatively designed, and probably very expensive:</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/falf/paul-smith.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is a pair of pants on sale at <a href="http://walmart.com">Wal-Mart</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/falf/walmart.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Beautiful?  I don&#8217;t know many people who would call this beautiful. Completely unremarkable.</p>
<p>And so it goes&#8230;from art to craft to commodity.</p>
<p>Now consider yourself as the customer here. My guess is that most of my readers, even with an appreciation of the quality of the Paul Smith suit, would be much more comfortable in the Wal-Mart pants.</p>
<p>When we create an item for another person, we have to consider whether that person is looking for art, craft, or commodity. We may wish to always be creating art. Or craft. But sometimes our customers want commodity. Not only is commodity cheaper but it&#8217;s what they <em>prefer</em>.</p>

    <link href="http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/12/21/re-thinking-software-development-education/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/12/21/re-thinking-software-development-education</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Where have I been lately?  Good question. When asked over these past months, I jokingly say something like, &#8220;These last 8 months at LivingSocial have been the best 4 years of my career.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t just mean I&#8217;ve been busy. I&#8217;ve been focused on building the best software development team I can to do what I think is some important and industry-changing work in the world of local commerce.</p>
<p>And when I joke about these 8 months being the best 4 years of my career, what I really mean is that I feel like I&#8217;ve learned 4 years worth of lessons and gained 4 years worth of experience. What we&#8217;re doing isn&#8217;t easy. It&#8217;s the kind of work I&#8217;ve always sought out.</p>
<p>I am a self-taught software developer. To date, my formal education consists of two 3-day training classes on specific programming languages (Java many years ago and Erlang in 2008). During my first work experiences in IT, I remember the shock of discovering that a Masters degree in software development doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate to knowing how to effectively use a computer. I was a saxophonist and system administrator and would regularly <em>teach</em> the computer scientists I worked with about things I would have assumed they learned in college.</p>
<p>As I headed further into the workforce I noticed another odd thing: people with tens of years of experience as software developers weren&#8217;t necessarily very good at it. My assumptions were based on what I had previously learned as a jazz musician.  Jazz musicians polish and hone their skills throughout their careers. The longer a jazz musician has been playing, the more likely he or she is to be an excellent jazz musician.</p>
<p>Programmers, though. As far as I could tell the average programmer spent his day complaining about his co-workers and waiting for 5pm.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the disconnect? Some of it, of course, is just the people. Some <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">programmers are passionate</a> and some aren&#8217;t. Those that aren&#8217;t, aren&#8217;t going to be radically successful. Assuming this is the case in all fields, what&#8217;s really frustrating to me is that I continue to run into passionate developers who just don&#8217;t know the right stuff.</p>
<p>When I started out in this field, I was lucky enough to stumble onto a mentor. That too was probably informed by my experience as an aspiring jazz musician. Jazz musicians take the idea of musical lineage seriously and look for someone from whom to receive direction on how to parse the potentially overwhelming task of going from novice to master jazz improviser. My mentor in the software field did the same. He told me: first learn these three things. He picked topics that were diverse but complementary. He picked skills that set a foundation on which it was easy to build the next set. Most new developers don&#8217;t get so lucky.</p>
<p>And It&#8217;s not just technology skills. The developers I work with are entrepreneurs at heart.  We aren&#8217;t sitting around polishing our tools and conducting thought experiments.  We&#8217;re delivering stuff that matters and we hate working on projects that drag on or don&#8217;t deliver value.  Becoming a great developer involves not just learning the ins and outs of software development but understanding how businesses work and exactly how software systems fit into that picture. It&#8217;s about delivering value quickly and iteratively. Great developers understand what Kent Beck and the rest of the authors of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>  were getting at a decade ago. And what people like <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Eric Ries</a> are teaching today.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve often thought &#8220;just give me 3 months with a smart person and I can have them running circles around the average developer.&#8221; Have you thought that too? I know a lot of my colleagues have.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to rethink how we educate software developers. Computers used to be huge scary machines in big white rooms that very few people touched. Today you probably have at least one computer ON <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BODY</span> most of the time. They&#8217;re ubiquitous and friendly and just <span class="caps">NOT</span> that hard to work with. The technology landscape has changed. The system of educating developers should change along with it.</p>
<p>My colleagues are clearly thinking along the same lines. I&#8217;ve seen speakers such as <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com/">Joe O&#8217;Brien</a> talking about it this year.  And we see programs popping up all over.  Software Craftsman Ken Auer is launching the <a href="http://craftsmanshipacademy.com/">Craftsmanship Academy</a> to teach apprentices the art and craft of software development in an intense hands-on residency-oriented program.  <a href="http://codeacademy.org/">Code Academy</a> is a part-time 12 week course to accelerate the path to web development or design.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re launching a new program at <a href="http://livingsocial.com">LivingSocial</a> called <a href="http://hungryacademy.com">Hungry Academy</a>.  Hungry Academy is a five month intense entrepreneurial immersion that will take raw, hungry talented programmers (and aspiring programmers!) and develop them into ultra-productive software engineers. Those that make it through to the end will be offered a position on our development team and paired with a mentor from LivingSocial&#8217;s growing list of some of the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/merbist/livingsocial">industry&#8217;s most talented software engineers</a>.  Best of all, we will <em>pay</em> you to attend.  Your <em>job</em> for five months is to take your craft and career to the next level.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t going to be easy. Some people will get in but won&#8217;t make it to the end. Those that do will spend five months gaining the best 4 years of experience of their careers.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2011-03-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/03/17/leaving-a-legacy-system</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since reading David Heinemeir Hansson&#8217;s post <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/predicting_06_enterprise_is_the_new_legacy.php">Enterprise Is the New Legacy</a> over five years ago, I&#8217;ve been chewing on something. The gist of the post was that &#8220;enterprise&#8221; is and should be a bad word, just like &#8220;legacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>But why is &#8220;legacy&#8221; a bad word to begin with?  The word makes most software developers and IT people ill.</p>
<p>In other fields and in life in general, the word &#8220;legacy&#8221; isn&#8217;t thusly encumbered.  It refers to an inheritance left to those behind you. Your life&#8217;s work. Your essential story.</p>
<p>In software, that story is assumed to be a tragedy.</p>
<p>But even in the case of software, &#8220;legacy&#8221; is an indication of success. Sure, old software was written with old technology. And most software (or indeed most things created by humans) has its share of warts and dark corners. But the fact that we refer to a piece of software as &#8220;legacy&#8221; indicates that it was successful enough to have been deployed and to have been used for enough good that it is now something we&#8217;re &#8220;left with&#8221; and that we must either maintain or replace.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t so bad, is it?  In an industry where <a href="http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/docs/chaos-report.pdf">more software projects fail or are &#8216;challenged&#8217; than succeed</a>, getting to legacy status is cause for celebration!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sad idea:  as developers, even when we <em>do</em> succeed, we tend to create things that are abandoned at great cost only a few years after we pour our hearts and souls into them. As rough as your last project might have been and as hard as the deadlines were, chances are your project will be disparaged and terminated <a href="http://www.graco.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tamai/pub/icsm92.pdf">within 10 years of its birth</a>.</p>
<p>So, what do we developers leave as a legacy? In most cases, we don&#8217;t leave much of anything.</p>
<p>At a previous job, a mission-critical core system ran on an ancient, customized mainframe with a custom <span class="caps">TCP</span>/IP stack and a custom relational database system. At the time, the system was over 25 years old. It performed well. It survived Y2K. It was well understood. It reliably ran our (big) business.</p>
<p>That was ten years ago. I&#8217;d be willing to bet it&#8217;s still running. If not the whole system, at least a subset.</p>
<p>That would make it 35.</p>
<p>Sure, it had its ugly parts. And most of us were terrified of it. But, hey! Still running and doing its business after 35 years. I hope I ever create something that successful.</p>
<p>How <em>would</em> I create something that had that kind of longevity?  How different would my designs be if I believed I was creating software to last 40 years?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s daunting, isn&#8217;t it? My knee-jerk reaction might be to do a Big Design Up Front. But how could I possibly design an entire system with 40 years of future knowledge in mind? I couldn&#8217;t. Even predicting next year is hard.</p>
<p>So maybe I&#8217;d need to design something that was ultimately flexible. A framework of frameworks where everything is pluggable.</p>
<p>Any software developer who lived through parts of the 90s knows these systems buckle under their own weight.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> how to design a system that could live a long and healthy life. I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> because I haven&#8217;t done it yet. Have you?</p>

    <updated>2011-03-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/03/15/the-harajuku-moment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, sitting in the July heat on a wall in the Harajuku district of Tokyo, I came to a conclusion: I had let myself be a loser. At least, I had let myself become a partial loser. I was fat and unhappy. My skin looked grey. I was slowly killing myself. I was obese. I made excuses to myself and others. I used my success in other areas as a justification: I just wasn&#8217;t a fitness guy.</p>
<p><strong>It was bullshit.</strong></p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/images/chad_fowler.jpg" alt="" /><br />

</p>
<p>These days I&#8217;m still not an elite athlete, but I&#8217;ve turned things around. I&#8217;ve lost nearly 100 pounds, gone from a max ability to run 45 seconds at a time to running a half marathon, and lost 10 inches around my waist.</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000ZHyRDf0HBX4/s" alt="" /><br />

</p>
<p>Before, I was incomplete. I allowed myself to believe in a partial picture of myself.  Now, I&#8217;m closer to the real me. I&#8217;m still a smart, creative guy. But I can also do more pushups in a row than the average American male, and can run longer and faster than most guys my age. And I feel great. I feel noticeably better almost all the time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m often asked by other obese and overweight people how I did it. People see me at conferences and other venues and literally don&#8217;t recognize me. How did I make such an incredible transformation?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve asked me this question, this post is for you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long story. But I&#8217;m going to give you the very very short version:  it was easy.</p>
<p>I could tell you exactly which system I devised and exactly what worked for me. But that would be missing the major point. The most important element of making a change like this is that it is <em>easy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>If you could trade your body for one that is 50-100% better in a year, what would you give? </strong> If you had asked me in early 2008, I wouldn&#8217;t have even believed it possible. I would have given a lot. What about 6 months? Obese or overweight people, what if I told you that in 6 months you could be in almost unrecognizably better shape? Would you jump on whatever I was selling?</p>
<p>The secret? I&#8217;m not selling anything. It&#8217;s just true. Choose <em>any</em> non-bullshit system and actually stick with it for 6 months and you can and will experience life-changing results. You can extend your life span significantly.</p>
<h2>If you&#8217;re reading this and you want to change, here&#8217;s what I want you to do:</h2>
<p>1. Recognize how deep in denial you&#8217;ve been<br />
2. Measure yourself now. If it&#8217;s weight that&#8217;s your issue, get on the scale immediately. Stand on it and cry. You probably haven&#8217;t been measuring it, and it&#8217;s probably worse than you think. Embrace how far you&#8217;ve gone in the wrong direction.  This is the end of that long, drawn out series of lies you&#8217;ve been telling yourself.<br />
3. Find any program that doesn&#8217;t look like snake oil and try it for 20 days. Measure your progress. If you don&#8217;t know what to try, start with 45 minute light cardiovascular exercise sessions 4 times per week (find a TV series to watch on a treadmill&#8230;a one hour show without commercials is about 42 minutes), forcing yourself to eat a protein-heavy breakfast within 30 minutes of waking, cutting out empty calories and sugars (coke, sugar-heavy &#8220;coffee&#8221; drinks, beer, etc.), and eating 5 small meals per day.<br />
4. After 20 days, you&#8217;re almost 1/6 of the way through a major transformation.  You have probably gone down one clothing size or are close to it. How far do you want to go? Pick something you didn&#8217;t previously think you were capable of and commit to it. Maybe it&#8217;s a bike race or a triathlon or doing Cross Fit.</p>
<p>The funny thing about huge change is that making it happen isn&#8217;t usually as huge an effort as we think. We just get stuck. All you have to do to go <span class="caps">ALL</span> of the way is to go <span class="caps">SOME</span> of the way.</p>
<p><i><br />
Note: I wrote a more detailed account of my weight loss story in <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com">Tim Ferriss&#8217;s</a> best selling book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X">The Four Hour Body</a>. I have no financial interest in the book, but having re-read my own chapter when Tim sent me a copy of the book last December, I was inspired enough to double down on my efforts to go from OK to awesome. I&#8217;ve lost 20 more pounds since January 1.  Tim&#8217;s advice for weight loss is solid, and (if I do say so myself) my chapter alone is worth the cost of the book.</p>

    <updated>2011-03-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/03/13/caring-like-crazy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading Gary Vaynerchuk&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thank-You-Economy-Gary-Vaynerchuk/dp/0061914185">The Thank You Economy</a>.  From the outside it looks like a book about marketing. It looks like a book for companies who need a &#8220;social media strategy&#8221;.  On the inside, it&#8217;s much more.</p>
<p>Everyone doing business of any sort has an important lesson to learn from The Thank You Economy.  Here&#8217;s that lesson in Gary&#8217;s own words (from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> keynote):</p>
<pre>
  "Giving a Fuck is comin' on strong!"
</pre>
<p>
<div class="video_embed"><object width="500" height="411"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-QWHkcCP3tA&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-QWHkcCP3tA&amp;rel=0&amp;egm=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="411" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="transparent"></embed></object></div>
</p>
<p>Gary uses this phrase over and over in the book: &#8220;caring like crazy&#8221;.  What does that mean?</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky wrote <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/05.html">a whole book</a> about how what you need out of people you work with is for them to be smart and to get things done. Having hired a ton of people myself (hundreds) and worked with a fair number of others, I have to disagree. Smart and gets things done are both excellent, important qualities.  But ultimately I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re smart. I&#8217;ve worked with my share of brilliant people who just don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Look at this exchange between <a href="http://twitter.com/coreyhaines">Corey Haines</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jgehtland">Justin Gehtland</a> from a few days ago:</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/giving_a_shit.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I worked with a <span class="caps">CEO</span> in India who embodied this idea I remember the first time I noticed it.  We walked in the front of the building and he noticed some trash on the lawn next to the security guard who was stoicly standing there staring at nothing.  Trash in India.  It&#8217;s everywhere.  I certainly didn&#8217;t notice. It seems like an impossibly uncontrollable problem.</p>
<p>In mid-sentence, he stops and runs over, picks up the trash and hurries back over to the guard who learns that we&#8217;re <i>not</i> going to have trash in our lawn and if the guard doesn&#8217;t care about his workplace he can go somewhere else. He wasn&#8217;t mean about it.  He was matter-of-fact. The guard tried to take the trash from him, but he wouldn&#8217;t have it.  He took it himself and threw it away.  He did this constantly.  Eventually, all of the guards started doing it. Then the programmers started doing it. In fact, anything broken, or dirty, or at all not right got fixed by whoever saw it. We were a culture of caring and it was going to be both superficially and deeply ingrained.</p>
<p>One of our people got severely injured a few months later in a motorcycle accident. He wasn&#8217;t wearing a helmet, as is very very common in India. From that day on, our <span class="caps">CEO</span> or I stood at the drive into the building refusing to allow employees in unless they were wearing helmets.  A couple of the employees couldn&#8217;t afford them, so our <span class="caps">CEO</span> personally bought them the best helmets he could buy.</p>
<p>He cared about the business (even the building it took place in) and he cared about the people. And you can be damned sure he cared about the work.  It was infectious.  It was viral.</p>
<p>If you <span class="caps">REALLY</span> care and you&#8217;re capable, I don&#8217;t care much how smart you are for most work that needs to be done. Give me someone passionate over an apathetic genius any day of the week.</p>
<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HCiSFoi0L.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>So this is my takeaway from The Thank You Economy.  Care like crazy. Whether you&#8217;re running a company or just running your career.  It&#8217;s sound obvious, but it&#8217;s oh too easy to forget and let it slide. Let a little apathy in, and it makes a mess. A cyncical remark, or a posted Dilbert cartoon are all it takes to start the wrong kind of culture of apathy. Care like crazy.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2011-02-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/02/24/be-careful-of-who-you-work-with</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You instinctively know that who you associate with matters a lot.  Our parents bring us up steering away and toward others who influence us.</p>
<p>But most of us don&#8217;t realize just how much those around us influence us.</p>
<p>As I recall in the introduction to <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a>, there was one specific event that turned the tide for me.  I had been chugging along in my slightly-above-average corporate job and experiencing what I considered to be the height of success.  Then I had an intense period during which, for a few months, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a whole new level of software developers.  It all came to a head when I went to the eXtreme Programming Immersion that Object Mentor taught.  After a week surrounded by brilliant developers and leaders in the field, I knew I had to do something different.</p>
<p>I had to be as much like them as I could.</p>
<p>In The Passionate Programmer, I quote Pat Metheny&#8217;s advice to young musicians: always be the worst musician in every band you&#8217;re in.  As a musician and as a programmer, I&#8217;ve tried Pat&#8217;s advice.  You play with a group of people better than you, and you&#8217;ll almost always play better.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3315/3613370192_30635de1cb_m.jpg" alt="" /><br />
http://www.flickr.com/photos/jazzuality/3613370192/</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good anecdotal advice.  If you don&#8217;t trust Pat, how about <a href="http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/">Nicholas Christakis</a>?  Nicholas is a social scientist at Harvard University.  Together with James Fowler of UC San Diego, his research focuses on how behavior and then even <span class="caps">EMOTION</span> spread through social networks.  Can behavior be epidemic?</p>
<p>Here are some things their research has shown to spread through social networks ilke disease:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/health/25cnd-fat.html?_r=1&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=nicholas%20christakis&amp;st=cse">Obesity</a>), <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0706154">Smoking</a>, <a href="http://www.annals.org/content/152/7/426.abstract">Alcohol Consumption</a>, and….<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2338.full"><span class="caps">HAPPINESS</span></a>!  Yes, emotional state is contagious.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/48/165829023_8e97572f07_o.jpg" alt="" /><br />
http://www.flickr.com/photos/saintbob/165829023/</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t insignificant numbers, either.  For example, obesity chances increase 57% if you have a friend who is or becomes obese.  And, more disturbing than that, this is an effect that is conducted through more than one node in the social graph.  If your friends&#8217; friends&#8217; friends are obese, <a href="http://bit.ly/eOY1LP">you are 10% more likely to be obese</a></p>
<p>If behavior spreads through social networks, then working in a toxic or slow-moving corporate environment is really really bad for you.  If you&#8217;re a consultant, you <span class="caps">MUST</span> fire the clients that bring you down a notch and seek out clients that pull you up.  If you&#8217;re a teacher, go where the students care about what they&#8217;re learning.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/02/18/automation-and-outsourcing/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/02/18/automation-and-outsourcing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s the difference between automation and outsourcing?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same everywhere, but here in the <span class="caps">USA</span> we&#8217;re deluged with fear-driven &#8220;news&#8221; reporting, decrying the theft or export of our jobs to low cost, less skilled, offshore labor.  Or even onshore &#8220;illegal&#8221; labor.  It might be Mexico. Or China. Or India.  In the 80s it was the Japanese. And it was robots and computers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to argue whether any of this is true or worth being upset about here.  <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">I&#8217;ve done it elsewhere.</a>  What I&#8217;m interested in here is the question: what if, as individuals, instead of fearing outsourcing, offshoring, and automation, we decided to use it to our advantage?</p>
<p>The standard argument against offshore outsourcing goes like this:  Offshore people don&#8217;t understand the work, or the culture, or don&#8217;t care about quality or just aren&#8217;t as good.  They might be cheaper by the hour, but they&#8217;re more expensive in the long run.</p>
<p>OK.  That&#8217;s a hard one to disprove.  It&#8217;s also kind of hard to prove.  Regardless, hold that thought</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/16/21042744_0640512665.jpg" alt="" /><br />
http://www.flickr.com/photos/dancoulter/21042744/</p>
<p>In this day and age, we&#8217;ve collectively gotten over the fear that computers will replace us all.  We&#8217;re used to the idea that certain tasks can and should be automated.  For the younger readers, did you know that there was such thing as a spreadsheet before computer existed?  That&#8217;s right.  It was roughly the same except a <em>person</em> had to calculate each value!  And if any numbers changed, guess what happened?  Someone had to recalculate them!</p>
<p>Anybody want that job?  I didn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s automation.  If you think <em>really</em> hard about what you do every day, I bet you can come up with a few things that could be automated so you wouldn&#8217;t have to do them anymore.  You wouldn&#8217;t feel bad about those things.  You&#8217;d be saving yourself time and saving your employers money if you could automate them.  Software developers spend their careers doing this for others.</p>
<p>Anything that could be done by a computer or a robot (roughly) just as well as it could be done by a human should be automated.  That frees the people up to <em>think</em>.  That&#8217;s what we want, ya?  Hurray!</p>
<p>Some tasks are almost automate-able.  But they just need that little extra push.  For example, human language is hard to parse.  It&#8217;s not exact enough to write reliable programs (usually) to read and act on.  So what do you do with those tasks that seem mundane enough to automate but can&#8217;t actually be done without a human?</p>
<p>Outsource!</p>
<p>Outsourcing might mean giving the task to a more junior person you already work with. It might mean hiring someone on another continent who costs a fraction per hour than you do and can be trained to do the mundane work you do.  It might mean taking on <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596518387">an apprentice</a> and teaching them as they handle the &#8220;easy&#8221; stuff.</p>
<p>But, the fact of the matter is, in the work that most of us do every day there are things we could have someone less experienced do for us. And if that person is happy to do it, benefits from it in some way, costs less than we do, or is just <em>willing</em> when we are not, it&#8217;s not a bad thing to try.</p>
<p>If you continually do things that are &#8220;below your pay grade&#8221;, you&#8217;re wasting precious time or money.</p>
<p>At the end of the day today, think about what you did today.  Given a little time, how much of it could have been automated?</p>
<p>Given a little time to document what needed to be done, how much of it could have been done just as well by someone else who is maybe less skilled or less expensive than you?</p>]]></content>

<p>The presentation is called &#8220;McDonalds, Six Sigma, and Offshore Outsourcing &#8211; Unexpected Sources of Insight&#8221;.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We software developers like to think of what we do as an art form (or a craft, if you&#8217;re at this conference). I was once asked to come up with a set of guidelines for creating great software so our (huge) company could more effectively use an offshore development team that had been delivering amorphous piles of crummy, nonworking code. I was frustrated and responded with something like this: &#8220;Give me a list of guidelines for how to make a beautiful song!&#8221; The nerve! Repeatable processes? Who did she think she was talking to?! This is a creative process! This is <span class="caps">ART</span>!!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve since grown up a bit and I&#8217;d like to talk about how I was wrong and how we can all hopefully learn from my mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/></p>
<p>
<p>In it, I tell the story of my experiences with the Six Sigma quality methodology and with offshore outsourcing, urging developers not to blindly write off potentially useful software development strategies based on hearsay and misunderstanding. I also propose a customer-driven, data-driven approach to software engineering, dovetailing off of InfoEther&#8217;s Chief Scientist, <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/blog">Glenn Vanderburg&#8217;s</a> recent ruminations on <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/282-lsrc2010-real-software-engineering">&#8220;Real Software Engineering&#8221;</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/02/09/rails-3-recipes-needs-tech-reviewers/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/02/09/rails-3-recipes-needs-tech-reviewers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: We got 8 times as many volunteers for Rails 3 Recipes reviews as we need.  You people are awesome!  Closing the call for help now.</b></p>
<p>The original <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_rr/rails-recipes">Rails Recipes</a> has been used by tens of thousands of Rails developers as they&#8217;ve worked toward mastering everyone&#8217;s favorite Web framework.  Five years later, and after the release of Rails 3, we&#8217;re seeing a new wave of Rails developers.  Through my work with <a href="http://infoether.com">InfoEther</a> and <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com">The Pragmatic Studio</a> it&#8217;s clear that an updated version of this classic would help a huge group of new Rails developers.</p>
<p>So here comes Rails 3 Recipes!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little over half way done with the new edition, which is full of both substantially updated and entirely new content.  Now I need your help.</p>
<p>Before we take the book to Beta, we need technical reviewers.  To tech review, you need to either already know Rails fairly well or be interested in trying to use the book to learn (some Rails knowledge is assumed).</p>
<p>In return for your comments, we&#8217;ll give you a free copy of the electronic and paper versions of the book as well as a mention in the book itself.</p>
<p>Interested?  If so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:rails3recipes@gmail.com">rails3recipes@gmail.com</a> and let us know your level of Rails expertise.  We can only handle a certain number of reviewers (probably 15), so we&#8217;ll be limited to accepting the first who get in touch.</p>
<p>To those who are interested, <span class="caps">THANK</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span>!!!!!!</p>
<p>If the original Rails Recipes&#8217; success is any indicator, Rails 3 Recipes is going to be <em>the</em> book every Rails developer will have sitting on his or her desk over the next couple of years. I&#8217;m very excited about it and looking forward to some feedback.</p>

    <link href="http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/02/09/how-rails-developers-do-ajax-with-jquery-in-2011/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/02/09/how-rails-developers-do-ajax-with-jquery-in-2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wanting to survey what the current state of the art in Rails Ajax development is, I asked this question on twitter:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chadfowler/status/35068144976404480"><img src="http://chadfowler.com/ajax_question.png" alt="Rails developers, how are you doing Ajax with JQuery these days? .js.erb templates? Rendering partials back old-style?"/></a></p>
<p>I got a lot of great responses!  44 last time I checked. Here&#8217;s what I found out people are doing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js">mustache.js</a></li>
	<li>Sending JavaScript back down to the client using .js.erb template files (Ryan Bates linked a couple of examples <a href="http://bit.ly/YCunh">here</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/dHbKW5">here</a>)</li>
	<li><a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.template/">JQuery templates</a></li>
	<li>Hitting <span class="caps">RESTFUL</span> endpoints and responding with <span class="caps">JSON</span> data to be manipulated on the client</li>
	<li>Using <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone">backbone.js</a></li>
	<li>Rendering partials and updating elements on the page with their raw content (the original old-school Rails way of doing it)</li>
	<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/mrb/sammyonrails">SammyOnRails</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is definitely a divide and a lot of opinion (suprise!) between those who are OK with delivering JavaScript and/or <span class="caps">HTML</span> from the server to be rendered on the client and those who prefer to deliver data and have the client process it.  I&#8217;d characterize the former as the less clean, more pragmatic approach and the latter as the idealistic cleaner approach.  It seems that tools like mustache.js, backbone, JQuery templates, and Sammy.js are tightening the gap between quick + dirty and slow + clean.</p>
<p>What do you think?  What did we miss?</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2011-01-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2011/01/15/i-don&#8217;t-know</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of watching <a href="http://scottchacon.com/">Scott Chacon</a> keynote at <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> this week. He spoke about how <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> &#8220;manages&#8221; its development team and product development.  I enjoyed the talk, and encourage you to download his <a href="https://github.com/schacon/ddd">slides</a> if you weren&#8217;t at the conference.</p>
<p>Scott is a very energetic speaker and talks really fast, so he ended his keynote with a lot of time to spare (something I wish I would do more often). So he took questions from the audience.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions were about trying to fit Github&#8217;s process into companies of very different profiles.  So, for example, &#8220;Would this work in blah blah blah environment that is totally different from Github?&#8221;  Scott&#8217;s answer was excellent in these several cases:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t blow the questions off. He then discussed possibilities.  But it was incredibly refreshing to hear &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; from a speaker being questioned in front of an audience of almost 1000 people.</p>
<p>I wrote in <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2">The Passionate Programmer</a> about the difficulty and importance of learning to say &#8220;no&#8221;. I think &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; is scarier and harder and maybe more important.</p>
<p>When someone regularly says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;, you trust them more when they say they DO know.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://chad.github.com/blog/2010/12/30/dead-end-jobs-are-you-suffering-from-stockholm-syndrome/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chad.github.com/blog/2010/12/30/dead-end-jobs-are-you-suffering-from-stockholm-syndrome</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome? It&#8217;s a name given to the condition wherein hostages develop positive feelings toward their captors despite being held in negative, unfavorable and even life-threatening conditions.  Victims of Stockholm Syndrome will even inexplicably stay with their captors even when given the chance at freedom.</p>
<p>Hopefully nobody reading this is literally being held hostage right now. If you are, good luck!</p>
<p>For the rest of you, why might I suggest that you are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome? Because employment relationships can manifest themselves in this very way.</p>
<p>In the article, <a href="http://drjoecarver.makeswebsites.com/clients/49355/File/love_and_stockholm_syndrome.html">Love and Stockholm Syndrome: The Mystery of Loving an Abuser</a>, Dr. Joseph Carver says that the following four situations serve as a foundation for the development of Stockholm Syndrome:</p>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<ul>
	<li>The presence of a perceived threat to oneâ€™s physical or psychological survival and the belief that the abuser would carry out the threat.</li>
	<li>The presence of a perceived small kindness from the abuser to the victim</li>
	<li>Isolation from perspectives other than those of the abuser</li>
	<li>The perceived inability to escape the situation</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>Looking back at my own career (specifically some of the extremely intelligent people I&#8217;ve met who are stagnating in oppressive companies or positions) I have recognized that many of these people (and sometimes myself) have felt &#8220;stuck&#8221; for no obvious reason. Some people seem just plain crazy when you look at their skill sets, ability, and the low quality of work or environment they&#8217;re willing to put up with.</p>
<p>So I contacted Joseph Carver to ask his opinion. Could this be Stockholm Syndrome?  He agreed. In email, he said &#8220;SS is most likely to develop when the employee feels trapped, perhaps by a high salary, fear of losing a career, or fear of humiliation.&#8221;  So let&#8217;s look at his four conditions:</p>
<h2>Perceived threat:</h2>
<p>Getting fired, being humiliated, not being a &#8220;top 20%&#8221; employee, not getting a raise. Employers wield a lot of perceived power over employees, especially for those in very traditional corporate jobs.  The employer <em>must</em> be willing to carry out the threat. Every business is under the right conditions. It&#8217;s how businesses work.</p>
<h2>Small kindness</h2>
<p>Got a Christmas bonus once when you really needed it? Make a competitive salary? Great benefits? Get to work on a technology you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to work on elsewhere?  There ya go.</p>
<h2>Isolation from other perspectives</h2>
<p>Again, a big corporate environment is <em>ripe</em> for this kind of isolation.  If you work for BigCo, you learn to do things The BigCo way.  The company&#8217;s organizational structure becomes a blueprint for your career progression.  You start to lose sight of what industry pay and incentives look like since you have a homogeneous population to compare with. Unfortunately, from what I&#8217;ve seen even the <em>best</em> run companies create this kind of isolation of perspective and group-think. Charismatic leaders are particularly capable of creating a culture vacuum around a cult of personality.</p>
<h2>Perceived inability to escape</h2>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, American adults <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.htm">spend by far more time working than any other activity.</a>  That&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of your waking time being trapped in a routine. In a Stockholm Syndrome situation, the captor chips away at the self-esteem of the captive. So for most of our waking hours, those of us trapped in dead end jobs like these are exposed to environments which systematically destroy our self-confidence.  Not only that, a persistent fear and feeling of failure makes it harder to actually explore the options for leaving the bad situation. The instinctive self-preservation reaction in this kind of situation is to work <em>harder</em> to try to avoid the perceived threat coming to fruition.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what if this describes your job?  You owe it to yourself to find a way out. Hopefully recognizing the signs will show you that the <em>real</em> situation is far less grim than you might believe and that you have control over how you choose to spend the <em>majority</em> of your adult life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing this for the many people I&#8217;ve met (and the countless I haven&#8217;t) that are senselessly stuck in bad job situations. Please stop wasting your precious time.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I asked this question on twitter:<br />
<pre><br />
Software developers: how do you know when it&#8217;s the right time to do a big software rewrite?<br />
</pre></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written about this topic before (<a href="http://chadfowler.com/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">The Big Rewrite</a>). I&#8217;m revisiting it for a presentation <a href="http://infoether.com">Rich Kilmer</a> and I are doing this weekend at <a href="http://jrubyconf.com">JRubyConf</a>.</p>
<p>I got a bunch of replies. Some serious, some sarcastic, some obviously filtered through the jading effects of a few Big Rewrites played out.  The answer ranged from &#8220;<span class="caps">NEVER</span>!&#8221; to &#8220;as soon as you feel like it&#8217;s necessary&#8221;.  The one consistent theme is that software rewrites are scary and the decision shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Drivers include maintenance cost, programmer happiness, politics, and fear.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the developers on Twitter said:</p>

<p></div> seriously, though, i believe when you lose confidence implementing changes it&#8217;s probably a good time to consider a rewrite</p>

a rewrite takes less time and has less risks involved than a functional conversion but results in lower quality as well.<br />
by functional conversion I mean a rewrite-from-scratch scenario, and by &#8220;rewrite&#8221; I meant &#8220;refactoring&#8221;</p>
