  <div class="article-content"><p>Francis Hwang, one of this year&#8217;s speakers, had the <a

which <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> attendees can add<br />
their names, photos, and a short description of themselves.</p>
<p>
<p>With the conference <em>tripling</em> in size this year, it&#8217;s<br />
actually possible that you won&#8217;t just happen to run into someone<br />
you&#8217;ve been wanting to meet unless you search for them.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Go add yourself. It&#8217;s fun.</p>
</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Rob, over at <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com">BusinessPundit</a>, <a
href="http://www.businesspundit.com/archives/002301.html">made a<br />
confession</a> last night about not being good at self-promotion. <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/WhyDoGeeksHateMarketing.rdoc,v">It&#8217;s<br />
not just us geeks</a> who are uncomfortable promoting ourselves.<br />
Here&#8217;s a guy who has been living and breathing entrepreneurialism for<br />
several years and who writes about it <em>daily</em>.</p>
<p>
<p>He closes with a paragraph that could have been lifted directly out of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti"><span class="caps">MJWTI</span></a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  What is it like where you work? Does your company reward the best employees,
  or the best at self-promotion? Is Donald Trump really a good businessman,
  or just a good self-promoter? Is there even a difference between the two?
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that, as an entrepreneur, the answer is (at least in part)<br />
&quot;no&quot;. If you can&#8217;t promote it, (in most cases) you<br />
can&#8217;t sell it. And if it doesn&#8217;t sell, it&#8217;s not valuable.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>As American and European software developers, we are increasingly exposed<br />
to people from &quot;low cost countries&quot; such as India, China, and<br />
various places in Eastern Europe. As I say in the wrap-up to <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">My Job Went<br />
to India</a>, love it or hate it, working with people from around the world<br />
is a skill that serious software developers need to cultivate.</p>
<p>
<p>I happen to know a lot about India. I speak Hindi. My <a
href="http://kellyjeanne.org">wife</a> and I lived in Bangalore for a year<br />
and a half. We enjoy Indian movies, we <em>love</em> Indian food, and we<br />
listen to a lot of Indian music. And, most relevant here, I know how to<br />
work with Indian software developers. It&#8217;s fair to say that, by US<br />
standards, I am an expert when it comes to Indian culture.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Cultural understanding is the backbone of a good working relationship with<br />
<em>anyone</em> (even understanding corporate vs. hacker culture). So I<br />
thought I&#8217;d try to help out with some fundamentals.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Imagine a new person showing up to work on your team and asking where he or<br />
she needed to <em><span class="caps">FPT</span></em> a file to or which version of<br />
<em>Serversion</em> you were using for version control. How impressed would<br />
you be? How much confidence would you have in the person? This is the kind<br />
of person that ends up being <a
href="http://thedailywtf.com/">lampooned</a> on the web.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If working with India is an important job skill, then horribly<br />
mispronouncing the name &quot;Chandra&quot; or &quot;Rohit&quot; is as bad<br />
a transgression as mispronouncing &quot;Subversion&quot; or constantly<br />
referring to the Web as &quot;The Dub Dub Dub&quot;. It&#8217;s probably<br />
worse, considering that many (most?) Indian names are based on the names of<br />
gods. It&#8217;s one thing to potentially insult someone by mispronouncing<br />
<em>their</em> name. It&#8217;s another altogether to butcher the name of<br />
their <em>god</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In this post I won&#8217;t give you enough to make you 100% accurate, but I<br />
can give you a few rules of thumb that will cover the vast majority of<br />
problems that I&#8217;ve seen Americans have:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>More often than you&#8217;d think, Indian names have the emphasis on the<br />
first syllable. This is the number one mistake I hear Americans making with<br />
Indian names. Even when you hear someone saying a name with the emphasis<br />
the right way, it somehow feels natural to us to emphasize the second (or<br />
later) syllable.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t assume a long &quot;a&quot; sound. Over time, we Americans have<br />
taught ourselves to at least <em>attempt</em> to pronounce European names<br />
correctly. We naturally try to apply the same rules to Indian names. If you<br />
see a &quot;a&quot;, it will either have the sound of &quot;cut&quot; (most<br />
common) or &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;father&quot;&#8212;<span class="caps">NEVER</span> &quot;a&quot;<br />
as in &quot;bake&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;e&quot; is always as in a cross between &quot;leg&quot; and<br />
&quot;lay&quot; and never as in &quot;Steve&quot; or the second syllable of<br />
&quot;clever&quot;. So &quot;Suresh&quot; would be pronounced &quot;Soo<br />
<em>Raysh</em>&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;i&quot; is always as in &quot;hit&quot; or the vowel sound of<br />
&quot;clean&quot;. Never &quot;i&quot; as in &quot;life&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;u&quot; is always like &quot;foot&quot; or &quot;brute&quot;. Never<br />
like &quot;cut&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;o&quot; is always like &quot;flow&quot;. Never like &quot;hot&quot;.</li>
<li>There aren&#8217;t many &quot;special&quot; rules. In English,<br />
&quot;ch&quot; can mean &quot;sh&quot; in some cases. When you see Indian<br />
names with &quot;ch&quot; in them, the &quot;ch&quot; is always as in<br />
&quot;Chair&quot;.</li>
<li>There is no &quot;th&quot; sound like we have in English. &quot;th&quot;<br />
makes an aspirated (harder and breathier) &quot;t&quot; sound. If you<br />
can&#8217;t hear and/or reproduce the aspiration, it&#8217;s better to err<br />
on the side of &quot;t&quot; as in &quot;Tom&quot; as opposed to<br />
&quot;th&quot; as in &quot;the&quot;. &quot;th&quot; as in &quot;the&quot;<br />
will always be wrong.</li>
<li>&quot;j&quot; is pronounced like an English &quot;j&quot;. Don&#8217;t try<br />
to Spanishize it into &quot;h&quot;.</li>
<li>When you meet someone from another country, take the time to ask them how<br />
to pronounce their name. Then try it and have them correct you. They<br />
won&#8217;t be offended. They will appreciate the fact that you actually<br />
tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Rohit Thakur&quot; &#8211; <em>Row</em> hit <em>Tah</em> koor</li>
<li>&quot;Ramesh&quot; &#8211; Ruh <em>mesh</em></li>
<li>&quot;Chandra&quot; &#8211; <em>Chun</em> druh</li>
<li>&quot;Venkatesh&quot; &#8211; <em>Ven</em> kah tesh</li>
<li>&quot;Rashmi&quot; &#8211; <em>Rush</em> me</li>
<li>&quot;Uday&quot; &#8211; oo <em>day</em> (not &quot;You day&quot;)</li>
<li>&quot;Ramana&quot; &#8211; <em>Rah</em> muh nuh (Don&#8217;t emphasize the second<br />
syllable, making it sound like &quot;Ramada (inn)&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://halostatue.ca/">Austin Ziegler</a> helped make my language<br />
less ambiguous, Fred LeMaster suggests</li>
<li>Fred LeMaster suggests watching English-language Indian movies (there are<br />
some really good ones!) to help learn the pronunciation. Some suggestions<br />
(his and mine) are <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0265343/">Monsoon<br />
Wedding</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0109206/">Bandit Queen</a>,<br />

wrote in with an excellent addition to the &quot;e&quot; section.</li>
<li><a href="http://climbtothestars.org/">Stephanie Booth</a> pointed out that<br />
&quot;what&quot; isn&#8217;t pronounced the same everywhere, so I changed<br />
the example to use &quot;cut&quot;</li>

It should start arriving in stores shortly.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In his announcement about <span class="caps">MJWTI</span>, <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> says:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        In 52 delightfully written calls-to- action, Chad explains how each
        of us can position ourselves not just to survive, but to prosper in
        the new, flatter world. Most end with an &amp;quot;Act on it!&amp;quot; section,
        suggesting specific actions we can take.

        I'm really proud of this book--in many ways it strikes me as the career
        equivalent of The Pragmatic Programmer.
</pre>
<p>
<p>I think of the entire book as a &quot;call to action&quot;. It&#8217;s<br />
about not letting yourself believe that you have to be a <em>victim</em> of<br />
whatever the economy and the &quot;greedy corporations&quot; do to you.<br />
It&#8217;s about how to take control of your career and play to<br />
<em>win</em>&#8212;not just to avoid losing. Sure, you can rally, protest,<br />
and vote, but don&#8217;t let that be your only plan.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><span class="caps">MJWTI</span> is set against a backdrop of IT offshoring and the economic shift<br />
that&#8217;s taking place, but as reviewer Vik Chadha pointed out,<br />
it&#8217;s not about Americans beating Indians out of jobs or Indians<br />
beating Americans. It&#8217;s about building things of <em>value</em> and<br />
making software developers better.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So don&#8217;t expect a pity party. There&#8217;s a fair amount of <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/WhyDoGeeksHateMarketing.rdoc,v">tough<br />
love</a>. But hopefully, you&#8217;ll <a
href="http://outofhanwell.com/blog/index.php?title=my_job_went_to_india&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">find<br />
the book rejuvenating</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        I walked away from this book rejuvenated, but it was more than a
        motivational pep talk. These are basics principles that every
        software developer should absorb, and honestly, I wish I had had this
        book before now.

        Each chapter is only several pages long, so you can read this book in
        large or small pieces. I've read it through once as a PDF, but I think
        any serious developer should get a printed copy. I want to be able to
        pick up the book in a week from now, open it to any chapter, and be
        reminded exactly what it is that makes a software developer great.
</pre>
<p>
<p>I sincerely hope and believe that those of you who read the book will find<br />
it helpful. I urge you to not only read it but to seriously use it (or<br />
steps it inspires) to create your own <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/talks/HowToKeepYourJob/HTKYJ.html">&#8220;Pragmatic<br />
Investment Plan&#8221;</a>. You might even want to, as <a
href="http://www.luisdelarosa.com/blog/2005/09/review_my_job_w.html">Luis<br />
de la Rosa is doing</a>, form a study/discussion group to help each other<br />
stay on course.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As always, I welcome comments by weblog, discussion forum, or <a
href="mailto:chad+mjwti@chadfowler.com">email</a>.</p>
</p>

        Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or
        predecessors Try to be better than yourself.

  <div class="article-content"><p>(via <a

According to a new survey by the <a href="http://www.simnet.org/">Society<br />
for Information Management</a>, <em>business</em> leaders in IT want<br />
employees who have <em>business</em> skills. Shocking, I know.</p>
<pre>
        &amp;quot;These weren't interviews with business managers or HR, these were the
        CIOs themselves, and so it's very interesting that they are putting
        such a high value on skills to help their business rather than just
        hiring the most technical person they can find&amp;quot;, Kaiser said.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Very interesting? What is the purpose of an employee if not to help the<br />
business that employs them?</p>

<p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammers.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went<br />

</p>
<pre>
  A lot of software developers---especially the most conceited ones, it
  seems---live with the misconception that their skill should be self-evident
  to any clued-in manager or employer. They are able to comfortably veil this
  lie inside the cloud of a make believe moral ethic: theyre just too humble
  to market their own abilities. Going out of their way to make their abiliities
  known would be brown nosing. And, no self-respecting programmer would
  be caught dead sucking up to The Man.

  This is all just an excuse. Actually, they're afraid.

<p>You see, it&#8217;s <em>comfortable</em> to condemn any kind of<br />
self-promotional activity. It&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s common. It&#8217;s<br />
the way of the flock.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Like one of those silly &quot;Question Reality&quot; bumper stickers,<br />
it&#8217;s just conformist behaviour dressed up in such a way that people<br />
who like to think of themselves as nonconformists can feel good about it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s fear of rejection.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But fear of rejection stops us from putting ourselves in situations where<br />
we <em>can</em> be rejected. The opposite of rejection is acceptance. And<br />
in an economy, acceptance is success.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If we want this profession of software development to thrive, we&#8217;re<br />
going to have to hand-hold or beat this mentality out of our people.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I promise. It&#8217;ll only hurt for a little while.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>In <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a>, I stress the importance of writing as a way to build your<br />
personal brand and make yourself more marketable. I specifically suggest<br />
that software developers open a weblog.</p>
<p>
<p>Marketing maverick <a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> just <a
href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/whos_there_the_.html">published<br />
a free ebook</a> called &quot;Who&#8217;s There?&quot; that goes into much<br />
greater depth about the how and why of blogging.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Why bother? Seth says:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        If you care about your personal brand and career and impact, you need a
        blog. And you should start the cycle of getting better at blogging.
</pre>
<p>
<p>A favorite quote:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        When you apply for a job, so do a thousand other people.
        When you see a house listing, so do a thousand other people.
        When you bid on a grilled cheese sandwich on eBay, so do a thousand other people.
</pre>
<p>
<p>mmmm.&#8230;grilled cheese.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/whos_there.pdf">mirrored the book here</a><br />
if you&#8217;re interested. It&#8217;s a short and very worthwhile read.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/">Alan Francis</a> is a long time<br />
industry veteran and agile development guru. I met him several years ago<br />
when he was my team&#8217;s coach at Object mentor&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.objectmentor.com/courses/xpImmersion">XP Immersion</a><br />
(taught by Robert Martin, Ron Jeffries, and Kent Beck).</p>
<p>
<p>More recently, he was one of the early draft reviewers of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">my book</a>. He had<br />
the following <a
href="http://blog.alancfrancis.com/2005/09/my_job_went_to_.html">to say<br />
about it</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        The book is, in my head at least, a companion volume to Pragmatic
        Programmer. PragProg gave a list of concrete advice for programmers
        to improve their programming. MJWTI (as the new book is affectionately
        known) gives a list of good concrete advice for programmer to improve
        everything else that makes them employable.
</pre>
<p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first comparison between <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic<br />
Programmer</a> that I&#8217;ve heard, and I hope it won&#8217;t be the<br />
last. Since reading it in 2000, The Pragmatic Programmer has been on my<br />
short list of books I recommend to every programmer I work with, because<br />
being a programmer and <em>not</em> having read it is a crime. It just has<br />
too much to offer the average programmer <a
href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/2296">to go unread</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If <span class="caps">MJWTI</span> can help as many people in as profound a way, the investment will<br />
have been well worth it to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are now sample chapters <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">available</a>, and<br />
the book can be pre-ordered (the <span class="caps">PDF</span> ships <em>now</em>, and the paper copy<br />
ships at the end of this month). I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts as<br />
you read it (even just the sample chapters). <a
