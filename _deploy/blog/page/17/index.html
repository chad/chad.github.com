  <div class="article-content"><p>Last week I flew to Montreal to keynote at <a
href="http://cusec.soen.info/"><span class="caps">CUSEC</span></a>. Mine was the opening keynote,<br />
titled <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/FightTheTraffic.rdoc,v">Fight<br />
The Traffic</a>. Other keynotes were to include <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> and <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.<br />
Unfortunately David ended up getting snowed in, so I also gave the closing<br />
keynote, which I called &quot;Rails is Boring, and Ruby is a Toy&quot;, and<br />
in which I described some of the salient philosophical features of Ruby and<br />
Rails and encouraged their application in other (less fortunate?) software<br />
environments.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="caps">CUSEC</span> is a wonderful conference. It&#8217;s arranged by Canadian software<br />
engineering students <em>for</em> software engineering students. The talks<br />
were engaging, and like most conferences, the in-between-session<br />
discussions were especially inspirational. The <span class="caps">CUSEC</span> organizers wooed me<br />
with the promise of speaking to the future of software development in<br />
Canada, and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. These were some smart,<br />
<em>passionate</em> kids.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It was my first chance to see Kathy&#8217;s <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7077">Creating<br />
Passionate Users</a> talk, which I can&#8217;t recommend more strongly. It<br />
will affect the way <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">I write</a>, work,<br />
and <em>consume</em> from now on. She&#8217;s got a book coming out in the<br />
not-too-distant future on the topic. I&#8217;m convinced that it will<br />
become and remain a classic.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I was particularly fond of my slides for the talk. I can say that without<br />
fear of sounding conceited, because I didn&#8217;t make them myself. My<br />
friend and cothinker, <a href="http://steveakers.blogspot.com/">Steve<br />
Akers</a> worked with me to <em>draw</em> the slides for my talk by<br />
<em>hand</em>. What follows is the title slide, but the rest are available<br />
on his site, <a href="http://www.moebot.com">Moe Bot</a>. Check &#8216;em<br />
out. You can also <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MoeBot">subscribe to<br />
his pictures via <span class="caps">RSS</span></a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/fight-the-traffic.png"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The sessions were recorded, so I&#8217;ll post a link when they&#8217;re<br />
available. On the mp3, you&#8217;ll be able to hear me make wretched noises<br />
on my soprano saxophone. Stay tuned. You won&#8217;t want to miss that.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Joel Spolsky has just <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">made<br />
a telling assertion</a>. He says that in an interview, if he lets<br />
programmers choose the language they want to use to implement some<br />
programming tasks, they&#8217;ll often choose Java these days. And this<br />
makes him worry:</p>
<pre>
  Instead what I'd like to claim is that Java is not, generally, a hard
  enough programming language that it can be used to discriminate
  between great programmers and mediocre programmers.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Why on <em>earth</em> would you want an interviewee to pick a<br />
<em>difficult</em> language? That&#8217;s a <em>bad</em> <em>sign</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As someone who has interviewed and hired a <em>lot</em> of programmers, let<br />
me counter with some advice of my own: If you give someone the task of<br />
digging a hole and offer them the tool of their choice, favor the one that<br />
chooses the auger over the garden spade.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Sure, seeing someone handle a nasty pointer issue tells you something. It<br />
tells you whether they can deal with nasty pointer issues. If you&#8217;re<br />
doing software that requires that sort of thing, by all means&#8212;force<br />
people to show you they can handle it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Software development happens at many levels. I&#8217;ve known a lot of<br />
programmers that are good at the low level stuff but not so great at coming<br />
up with the high level architectures or the fluffy stuff that make a user<br />
<em>love</em> an application. And vice versa. I&#8217;m not convinced that<br />
all programmers can and/or will be great at both. I&#8217;d even go so far<br />
as to say that different parts of the brain and potentially different<br />
<em>people</em> are going to be right for these different layers and types<br />
of application development.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Joel feels that low(ish) level languages like C and C++ with their pointers<br />
and other various &quot;hard stuff&quot; are necessary to weed people out<br />
of the industry. The ones that can&#8217;t handle the hard stuff in the<br />
languages are the ones that were never meant to be programmers in the first<br />
place.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What worries me is that this will weed out the artists and the<br />
craftspeople, leaving us with nothing but a bunch of engineers. Sometimes<br />
you need an engineer. Sometimes you need an artist.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What you <em>always</em> need is someone capable of choosing the right tool<br />
for the job.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>A small but not insignificant percentage of readers of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> have surfaced a bit of a theme. It&#8217;s a theme that surprises<br />
me, though if I had read my own book it really shouldn&#8217;t.<br />
Here&#8217;s a snippet from &quot;Tolak&quot;, an Amazon reviewer, that<br />
calls the book &quot;Useful but ultimately hypocritical&quot;:</p>
<pre>
        In the final analysis, if one views a career as a
        product or a project to be managed accordingly, as demanded
        in this book, scope creep looms as a problem that's never discussed.
        Where the reader to follow the advice, they would not have the time for
        family life, leisure, rest and the general pursuit of happiness
        that their fellow American workers, those not in the IT industry,
        are entitled to.
</pre>
<p>
<p>And another reviewer, going by &quot;alefinus&quot; says:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        The book is engaging and well written. Many points brought by the
        author are indisputable. It is unfortunate that in order to act on
        just a few of them one need to have a strong will and a lot of spare
        time.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Unfortunate. Strong will. Why should anyone need to have the <em>will</em><br />
to succeed? Why can&#8217;t we just succeed because, say, we&#8217;re<br />
American? Isn&#8217;t that one of the rights afforded us in one of those<br />
parts of the Constitution or something? Seems like we should be able to<br />
just watch an infomercial, call our congressperson, and wait for the postal<br />
service to deliver the letter announcing that success has arrived.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If I&#8217;m going to hire someone without the will to succeed, I might as<br />
well pay as little as possible, right?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>These reviews have brought out a point that I feel is important to<br />
emphasize to avoid any further loss of time or money: <span class="caps">MJWTI</span> is not a book<br />
for people who lack the will to succeed. If you don&#8217;t have the will<br />
to succeed, stick to romance novels or the comic section of the newspaper.</p>

post</a> came through on the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a><br />
mailing list today.</p>
<pre>
  Hi,
  having read &amp;quot;my job went to india&amp;quot; I decided to quit programming within
  the Microsoft environment and start something different...

  So, is there any RubyOnRails project that in exchange for &amp;quot;reviving&amp;quot; me
  needs a loyal (code) contributor?

  Thanks in advance
  Michael
</pre>
<p>
<p>Welcome, Michael. You&#8217;ve taken the first step: <em>acting</em> on<br />
your <em>own</em> behalf.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s heartening to see this kind of thing happen as a result of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">words I have<br />
written</a>. I&#8217;m not going to definitively say that moving away from<br />
.<span class="caps">NET</span> is the right move for Michael. But <em>deciding</em> to control the<br />
course of his career <em>is</em> the right move. He may fear the Offshoring<br />
tide. Or he may have even already been laid off. (Or neither). But sitting<br />
around being scared, shaking your fist at Lou Dobbs&#8217; propaganda on<br />
<span class="caps">CNN</span> isn&#8217;t going to get you anywhere. The only way to get anywhere is<br />
to <em>move</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Michael is doing. Good going, Michael!</p>
