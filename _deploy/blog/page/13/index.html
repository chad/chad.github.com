  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> registration is open.</p>
<p>And, as they did last year, the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com">Pragmatic Studio</a> are donating their time to produce <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/02#RailsGuidebook07">The Rails Guidebook</a> to help those new to Ruby and/or Rails with a full day tutorial to help them get more out of the conference.  This year, while entrance is technically free, Dave, Mike, and Nicole are requiring a $75 charitable contribution.</p>
<p>Last year, the Rails community raised around $8,000 for charities through the Guidebook.  With the conference doubling in size this year, it would be great to see us hit upwards of $20,000.   You don&#8217;t have to attend the session to donate.  See Mike&#8217;s post for details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few upcoming tidbits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m flying to London late this week to teach my Rails intro course for <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course">Skills Matter</a>.  The course runs from Feb 5-8.  If you&#8217;re in the area of the UK and you&#8217;ve been looking for a way to dive into Rails, now&#8217;s  your chance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>On February 9, also in London, Skills Matter is putting together a one day Rails mini-conference called <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/rorexchange">The RoR eXchange</a>.  I&#8217;ll be speaking, as will a host of other Rails developers.  I&#8217;m particularly looking forward to seeing Tom Locke&#8217;s <a href="http://hobocentral.net/blog/">Hobo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Tickets are <a href="http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=126426">on sale</a> for the first <a href="http://mtnwestruby.org/">Mountain West Ruby Conference</a>.  The conference will be from March 16-17 in Salt Lake City.  It&#8217;s another in a chain of regional Ruby conferences that have been popping up around the country.  The speaker list for the Mountain West conference is particularly interesting&#8212;especially the Ruby implementers&#8217; panel and summit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>For the past several years, O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a> has featured a really nice Ruby track.  This week is the <em>last week</em> to get a proposal in for this year&#8217;s conference.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Registration for the second <a href="http://railsconf.org">International Rails Conference</a> should be opening <em>this week</em>.  Last year sold out fast, and RubyConf sold out even faster.  If these two data points are part of a trend, you&#8217;ll need to stay alert if you want a ticket.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Update: <a href="http://hasmanythrough.com/">Josh Susser</a> reminded me that I neglected to mention that the <span class="caps">CFP</span> for the Silicon Valley Ruby Conference is <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/1/26/rfp-silicon-valley-ruby-conf-2007">out</a>.  We had a great time last year.  Recommended if you&#8217;re looking for a Ruby gathering on the West coast.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to India</a>, I talked about using supply and demand as a gauge with which to make decisions about which technologies you should invest in as a software developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The offshore market has injected its low-cost programmers into a relatively narrow set of technologies. Java and .<span class="caps">NET</span> programmers are a dime  a dozen in India. India has a lot of Oracle DBAs as well. Less mainstream technologies are very much underrepresented by the offshore development shops.  When choosing a technology set to focus your career on, you should understand the effects of increased supply and lower prices on your career prospects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a .<span class="caps">NET</span> programmer, you may find yourself competing with tens of thousands of more people in the job market than you would if you were, for example, a Python programmer. This would result in the average cost of a .<span class="caps">NET</span> programmer decreasing significantly, possibly driving demand higher (i.e., creating more .<span class="caps">NET</span> jobs). So, youâ€™d be likely to find jobs available, but the jobs wouldn&#8217;t pay all that well. The supply of Python programmers might be much smaller than that of .<span class="caps">NET</span> programmers with a demand to match.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Python job market were to support noticeably higher prices per-programmer, additional people might be attracted to supply their services at this higher price range, resulting in competition that would drive the price back down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole thing is a balancing act. But, one thing seems certain (for now). India caters to the already balanced IT services markets. You donâ€™t find mainstream Indian offshoring companies jumping on unconventional technologies. They aren&#8217;t first-movers. They generally don&#8217;t take chances.  They wait for technology services markets to balance, and they disrupt those markets with significantly lower per-programmer costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, one of the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">Rails Core</a> guys passed along an interesting link to and article called <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2007/01/09/whos-searching-for-xml/">Who&#8217;s Searching for <span class="caps">XML</span>?</a> by <span class="caps">XML</span> noteworthy, David Megginson.</p>
<p>David used <a href="http://google.com/trends">Google Trends</a> to compare and contrast where searches for certain technologies were coming from geographically.  Have a look at a few:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=j2ee&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">J2EE</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=xml&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all"><span class="caps">XML</span></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=xml&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Java</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=C#&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">C#</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=ASP&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all"><span class="caps">ASP</span></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=Spring%20Framework&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Spring Framework</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=Hibernate&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Hibernate</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=Struts&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Struts</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=Servlet&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Servlet</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=EJB&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all"><span class="caps">EJB</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now look at these:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=Ruby+on+Rails&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=Smalltalk&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Smalltalk</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=lisp&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">Lisp</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/trends?q=ocaml&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">OCaml</a> (I especially enjoyed both Urbana and Champaign being high on this list)</li>
</ul>
<p>As David says, it&#8217;s totally unscientific.  But if I were a young programmer trying to figure out where to invest my time, I might spend just a little of it on Google Trends researching who I&#8217;m likely to be competing with.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in November, I did a presentation for the <a href="http://xpwestmichigan.org/">XP West Michigan</a> at the <a href="http://atomicobject.com">Atomic Object</a> office in Grand Rapids.  They&#8217;ve recently posted the talk to <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8984753198261505541">Google Video</a>.</p>
<p>The talk was titled &#8220;Don&#8217;t Follow the Lemmings&#8221; and is a continuation of the thoughts laid out in my book, <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to India</a>.</p>
<p>It being on Google Video, you can watch it online (embedded here, in fact) or download it to your computer or iPod for off-line viewing (a discovery I&#8217;ve recently made which makes plane trips much more enjoyable).</p>
<p>Watching on an iPod should be fine, because there are no slides to squint at.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early in my career, I worked as a computer support person in the IT department of a state university.  There was a batch of us that came in at the same time.  We all started at the help desk, worked our way into doing service calls around campus, and eventually graduated to back-room system administration or programming.</p>
<p>After you graduated into the back room, the next step was to get a <em>real</em> job.  I mean, the university job was fun, but the pay wasn&#8217;t so great.  Especially if you started as a help desk person.  Minimum wage is a bad starting point to get increments from as a computer professional.  So, for that reason, back in the back room it was pretty common to hear colleagues on phone interviews.</p>
<p>A close friend of mine had a particularly funny interview that a few of us heard his end of.  It went something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t used Windows NT <em>Advanced</em> Server, because there&#8217;s no such thing.  I&#8217;ve done <em>advanced things</em> with NT Server.&#8221;  He said it snottily.  Still sore from sitting at the help desk helping users with their &#8220;<span class="caps">FTP</span>&#8221; problems, he found it difficult to hide his distaste for ignorance.  The problem is, there actually <em>was</em> such a thing as Windows NT Advanced Server.  He just hadn&#8217;t heard of it.  Before he finished the interview, another friend went into his cubicle, retrieved a copy of Windows NT Advanced Server, and place it on his desk.</p>
<p>This brings us to the point of this post.  Yesterday, registration for Pragmatic Studio&#8217;s March <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/railsadvanced/index.html">Advanced Rails Studio</a> in Chicago has opened.  So far this year, we&#8217;ve only got one of these on the schedule, and they tend to sell out fast.  Mike, Dave, and I are proud of what we&#8217;ve put together for this class.  We did the first one back in the fall and got great reviews from the attendees.  It was a joy to teach and (we think) a joy to attend.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, being pretty close to what&#8217;s happening in the Rails world, I can confidently tell you that there&#8217;s no such product or piece of software as &#8220;Advanced Rails&#8221;.  But we&#8217;ve done <em>advanced things</em> with Rails, and we&#8217;re going to show you how. :)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the first <a href="http://therailsedge.com">Rails Edge conference</a>, <a href="http://onestepback.org">Jim<br />
Weirich</a>, <a href="http://codefluency.com">Bruce Williams</a>, and I were chatting about how to improve the<br />
<a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> platform-specific behavior, when we realized that it would be<br />
really helpful to have more info about the install footprint of the<br />
Ruby community at large.</p>
<p>So instead of going right into hacking RubyGems as was our plan, we<br />
created a little census tool and an accompanying web site to help us<br />
collect information.  Most of the info we collect is from<br />
Config::<span class="caps">CONFIG</span>, with the addition of the RubyGems version.</p>
<p>We know this information will help the implementers of RubyGems, and<br />
we hope it will also help Ruby implementers and library developers as<br />
well.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<p>$ sudo gem install tattle</p>
<p>To submit your info:</p>
<p>$ tattle</p>
<p>If you want to see what would be posted before posting, you can do:</p>
<p>$ tattle report</p>
<p>The information gets posted to <a href="http://tattle.rubygarden.org">http://tattle.rubygarden.org</a>.  You can<br />
view the posted data with your web browser at that <span class="caps">URL</span>.</p>
<p>As a side note, Eric posted the <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/articles/2007/01/07/rubygems-beta-0-9-0-9">latest RubyGems beta</a> this weekend.  Please do give it a go if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had the privilege of writing a tutorial for <a href="http://dabbledb.com">Dabble DB&#8217;s</a> new <a href="http://dabbledb.com/blog/?p=69">plugin <span class="caps">API</span></a>.  If you haven&#8217;t heard of Dabble DB yet, it&#8217;s one of the few really innovative applications you&#8217;ll find with the &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; label.  For a quick look at what it&#8217;s all about, check out the <a href="http://dabbledb.com/blog/?p=66">popular</a> <a href="http://dabbledb.com/explore/7minutedemo/">7 minute demo movie</a> that <a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/">Avi</a> made.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not planning to use Dabble DB, I think it&#8217;s worth reading <a href="http://dabbledb.com/help/guides/pluginapi/">the tutorial</a> to see how they&#8217;ve implemented plugins.  It may have been done before, but I haven&#8217;t seen it done like this.  When you host an application on the open internet, how do you allow users to safely &#8220;plug&#8221; their own code into your application?  You could go to a lot of trouble and create a sandboxed interpreted environment inside your application, exposing an <span class="caps">API</span>.  But that&#8217;s really really hard to do.</p>
<p>What Smallthought did might be more aptly called &#8220;plugouts&#8221;.  Instead of just exposing services that you can consume into your own mashup, they allow Dabble DB to call out to custom, internet-accessible services.  And, rather than clutter things up with an ugly <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="caps">API</span>, they deal in simple <span class="caps">CSV</span> in and out, kind of like <span class="caps">UNIX</span> pipes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens with this both in Dabble DB and other applications that start to adopt this approach.  Immediately after the plugin API&#8217;s release, there are already <a href="http://timcraft.com/2007/7">a couple of publicly available plugins</a> (from an apparent Rubyist.  Hi Tim!)</p>
<p>What other interesting approaches have you seen to accomplish this same goal?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">(This article is part of the <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">Big Rewrite</a> series.)
<p>While we&#8217;re all in the back creating the next revision of a product, who&#8217;s tending to the day to day issues of the existing product?  Typically, it&#8217;s the domain experts and the original implementers of the product.</p>
<p>Regardless of our intentions, day to day life and in-your-face time-sensitive issues can very easily steal all of the attention from a Big Rewrite.  Screaming customers need their problems solved.  Outages and serious bugs need to be fixed.  Enhancements have to keep rolling in if your project takes as long as projects tend to take.  Somebody has to do these things.  Training new people is hard and doesn&#8217;t seem to make sense.  If we&#8217;re getting rid of a system, why would we train someone how to maintain it?</p>
<p>So, the experts keep the old system running while the new system is being built.  So, who builds the new system?  Not the experts, that&#8217;s who.  Usually, it&#8217;s people like me:  technology experts.  And while we&#8217;re banging away at the existing system&#8217;s UI, trying to figure out what needs to be coded, the domain experts are doing their jobs.  Unfortunately, this means the domain experts aren&#8217;t watching the Big Rewrite very closely.  Regardless of how good the team, if communication is impaired between the domain experts and the technology experts, things are going to move slowly, and wrong software is going to be created.</p></div>
