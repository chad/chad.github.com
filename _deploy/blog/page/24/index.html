  <div class="article-content"><p>This week, we released a new version of <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>. We haven&#8217;t done<br />
very well with Open Source&#8217;s &quot;Release Early&#8212;Release<br />
Often&quot; rule of thumb (on either count). But, we have added a lot of<br />
new stuff. Because there are so many new features stacked up, we need a lot<br />
of help putting this release through its paces. Specifically:</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
<p>We&#8217;ve added the ability to install &quot;applications&quot;. With the<br />
previous RubyGems release, you could install libraries, but if you had an<br />
executable program included with your package, there was no direct support<br />
for installing it. Now, you can do this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ sudo gem -Ri rake
   Attempting remote installation of 'rake'
   Successfully installed rake version 0.3.2
  tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ rake --version
   rake, version 0.3.2
</pre>
<p>
<p>Because RubyGems allows multiple versions of the same package to co-exist,<br />
we auto-generate an executable script that points to the real location of<br />
the script (in the gems directory). It looks like this for now:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'rake', &amp;quot;0.3.2&amp;quot;
  load 'rake'
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been considering adding an option that would allow the<br />
&quot;0.3.2&quot; part to be overridable, so you could do something like:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  rake --gem-version 0.3.1
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about that yet.</p>
</p>
<h2>Binary Gems</h2>
<p>
<p>The previous release of RubyGems only supported installation of either pure<br />
Ruby gems or pre-compiled, platform-dependent gems (e.g. x86 Linux<br />
XMLParser). We recognize the need for two things: 1) Installation of<br />
extensions from source and 2) &quot;intelligent&quot; selection of<br />
precompiled gems in the remote installation process. <a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/">Rich</a> took a stab at the first<br />
of these. A gemspec can now contain a reference to one or more extconf.rb<br />
scripts, which will be run (to generate a Makefile), followed by a<br />
&#8216;make install&#8217;:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  spec.extensions &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;ext/mygem/extconf.rb&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested this one with an <span class="caps">RDF</span>/<span class="caps">OWL</span> library that Rich is working on<br />
as well as with <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ripper">Ripper</a>.<br />
We could use help testing it and (probably) making it work on Windows. It<br />
seems like this would be a fragile area, so the more gems we see and test,<br />
the better. If you&#8217;ve got a Ruby/C extension&#8212;especially if it<br />
does something unusual&#8212;please consider making a gem of it and sending<br />
it in.</p>
</p>
<h2>Gem Testing</h2>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got unit tests for your library or application, you can<br />
include them in your gem spec, and users will have the option of running<br />
them at install time. If tests fail, RubyGems will ask the user if they<br />
would like to keep the software or remove it. You specify a test suite by<br />
adding a pointer to a file that references all of your tests to the gem<br />
specification:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   spec.test_suite_file = &amp;quot;test/all_tests.rb&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>Then when you run</p>
</p>
<pre>
   gem -Ri my-well-tested-lib --run-tests
</pre>
<p>
<p>the RubyGems system will download, install, and run the library&#8217;s<br />
tests.</p>
</p>
<h2>Library Stubs</h2>
<p>
<p>Typically, to use a gem, you have to do something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem &amp;quot;somegem&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;gt;= 1.0.0&amp;quot; # version spec is optional
</pre>
<p>
<p>This will load the RubyGems library and then add <tt>somgem</tt> to the<br />
LOAD_PATH and load whatever libary is listed as the gem&#8217;s<br />
&quot;autorequire&quot;. So, in most cases, these two lines will load<br />
everything you need in order to use an external library.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There have been various hacks and work-arounds suggested to avoid having to<br />
1) require the RubyGems library and 2) use the special<br />
&quot;require_gem&quot; as opposed to a normal &quot;require&quot;. Gavin<br />
Sinclair went ahead and implemented one of them, installing a library stub<br />
(similar to the application stub mentioned above) into Ruby&#8217;s<br />
&quot;site_ruby&quot; directory. So, if your gem&#8217;s autorequire is<br />
&quot;rss/rss.rb&quot;, it will be possible to</p>
</p>
<pre>
   require 'rss/rss'
</pre>
<p>
<p>and a stub library will load RubyGems and use &quot;require_gem&quot; to<br />
load the &quot;rss&quot; library. The behavior is optional and turned off<br />
by default in the current <span class="caps">CVS</span> (left it on for the 0.3.0 release). To<br />
install a library with the stub, you just do:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ gem -Ri rubyzip --install-stub

   tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ ruby -e 'puts require &amp;quot;zip/zip&amp;quot;'
   true
</pre>
<p>
<p>Of all the hacks and work-arounds, I think I like this one the best,<br />
because it actually installs a real file that gets require&#8217;d instead<br />
of replacing Ruby&#8217;s require at runtime. Having said that, though I<br />
like it better than the other ways, I&#8217;m still not sure if I like it.<br />
Time will tell. I&#8217;d be interested in hearing reactions from users.</p>
</p>
<h2>Config/Preferences File</h2>
<p>
<p>Gavin also created a simple config file option for the &quot;gem&quot;<br />
command. It looks by default for ~/.gemrc, though it can be overridden by<br />
the &quot;&#8212;config-file&quot; option of the &quot;gem&quot; command.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The config file is in <a href="http://www.yaml.org"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> format with,<br />
at the time, only two options. It looks something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   gem: --gen-rdoc --run-tests
   rdoc: --template kilmer
</pre>
<p>
<p>This config file will cause &quot;&#8212;gen-rdoc&quot; and<br />
&quot;&#8212;run-tests&quot; to be prepended to all invocations of the<br />
&quot;gem&quot; command and will cause the &quot;kilmer&quot; template to<br />
be used when generating rdoc documents. This is a good way to make<br />
non-default behavior the default for you. Someone was asking on irc that,<br />
for example, &#8212;gen-rdoc be on by default. There was an informal vote<br />
showing that only one person wanted this feature to be on by default.<br />
Fortunately for him, .gemrc can do that.</p>
</p>
<h2>Library Versioning</h2>
<p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion around library versioning between these<br />
releases. We haven&#8217;t actually done anything about it, and I have to<br />
admit that it&#8217;s making me tired. <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rubygems-developers/2004-April/000267.html">Here</a><br />
and <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rubygems-developers/2004-April/000294.html">here</a><br />
are good places to start if you&#8217;d like to take a peek into the<br />
debate. It centers around how to deal with <span class="caps">API</span>-level incompatibilities in<br />
libraries. There are four leading solutions, none of which are really all<br />
that great:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a new <span class="caps">API</span> version number which is unrelated to the gem version<br />
number</li>
<li>Make the gem version number have some implicit meanings, the worst of which<br />
is that &quot;&gt; 1.0&quot; would implicitly mean &quot;&lt; 2.0&quot;.<br />
This one <b>really</b> bothers me. &quot;Greater than one&quot;<br />
shouldn&#8217;t implicitly mean &quot;less than two&quot;.</li>
<li>Add the ability to specify a version dependency that looks like<br />
&quot;1.<strong>.</strong>&quot; (any version in the &quot;1&quot; family)</li>
<li>Ignore the issue until it becomes an actual problem. It probably<br />
won&#8217;t be hard to get around anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>So far, I&#8217;ve personally been doing the latter. I&#8217;m sure there<br />
will come a time when something needs to be done about this, but I<br />
don&#8217;t think the sky is falling just yet. Someone probably need to<br />
spend a day or so looking through similar systems to see how it&#8217;s<br />
done.</p>
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to work on a project that you hope <b>everyone</b><br />
in your &quot;community&quot; will use while also being a user yourself. If<br />
I were doing an editor or a piece of weblog software, I could just make<br />
decisions based on how <b>I</b> would like to use it. But since we&#8217;re<br />
trying to create software to pervade throughout the Ruby community, we have<br />
to do things (sort of) by committee. It&#8217;s much harder to justify a<br />
unilateral decision, which creates a different tone during development.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>RubyGems is an interesting project, because it&#8217;s <b>useless</b><br />
unless it becomes the standard.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, Ruby programmers, please download <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/600/rubygems-0.3.0.tar.gz">RubyGems<br />
0.3.0</a> and install it. Install some gems and use them, and then <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?CreateAGemInTenMinutes">make<br />
gems</a> of your own libraries and send them in. If you don&#8217;t have<br />
libraries to make gems of, make some gems out of other people&#8217;s<br />
libraries and send the gemspecs to the authors. Ruby <b>needs</b> a<br />
standardized package management system. This problem is 20% technical and<br />
80% social. Every little bit can help.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a
href="http://www.anomaly.org/wade/archives/programming_philosophy/000050.html">G.<br />
Wade Johnson on programming idioms.</a></p>
<p>
<p>A lot of what he says relates very clearly to the motivation behind <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/5303">this<br />
talk</a> that David Black and I are giving at <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a> in July. New<br />
speakers of Ruby-as-a-second-language often feverishly attempt to force-fit<br />
Ruby into being a syntactically different copy of whatever their<br />
&quot;native&quot; language is. An oft-cited example from the Ruby world is<br />
static vs. dynamic typing (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/RubyTypesAndClasses.rdoc,v">RubyTypesAndClasses</a>),<br />
but it definitely doesn&#8217;t end there.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot easier to learn a new programming language than it is to<br />
learn a new spoken/written language. It may be for this reason that, when<br />
learning a new spoken language, we tend to come with humility, but when<br />
learning a new programming language, the attitude of the learner is usually<br />
a lot less humble. So, new users of a language assume that they already<br />
know the one true way to express programming constructs, and the only task<br />
at hand is to learn how to syntactictally convert their thoughts into the<br />
new language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are exceptions in each camp, of course. An Indian friend of mine<br />
described a college professor who refused to learn idiomatic English and<br />
would constantly use direct translations of colloquial Malayalam phrases in<br />
class. His favorite, used when students were bugging him about something,<br />
was (emphatically) &quot;Don&#8217;t want&#8212;Don&#8217;t want. Climbing<br />
on my head!&quot; In Malayalam, this phrase means something and has<br />
probably evolved based on a combination of factors, including how easily it<br />
flows from the tongue. In English, it&#8217;s just strange sounding<br />
nonsense. Since programs actually have to work (i.e. there is a<br />
fast-feedback validation that happens when we write a program), programmers<br />
will sometimes go to great lengths, building elaborate frameworks to<br />
attempt to make a new language behave like their &quot;native&quot;<br />
language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Wade (is it &quot;Wade&quot;?) talks about idioms as being singular items<br />
that can be learned, like patterns or tricks. You learn one, you over-use<br />
it, you start to use it correctly, and then you learn another. I know<br />
he&#8217;s presenting a simplified look at the process, but I think<br />
it&#8217;s important to separate the learning of a language&#8217;s idioms<br />
from learning what is idiomatic in that language. Learning of idioms is<br />
about knowledge transfer whereas learning about &quot;idiomatic&quot;<br />
requires a thought process change. I think of the former as being a step<br />
toward the latter.</p>
</p>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>On an unrelated note, Wade makes an interesting point about what I would<br />
call &quot;dissonance&quot; (see <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/SeasideDissonance.rdoc,v">SeasideDissonance</a><br />
and <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA/Tension"><span class="caps">MFA</span>:Tension</a>).</p>
</p>
<pre>
   Idiom can also serve as a warning. An unusual or advanced idiom
   should tell the reader that he is entering dangerous territory. This
   is a message that it's time to pay close attention.
</pre>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>On another unrelated note, I think we must define both &quot;simple&quot;<br />
and &quot;expressive&quot; differently:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  The simpler the language, the quicker you get to the end of this cycle.
  But, a simpler language is not as expressive. So, you find yourself doing
  more work than should be necessary. A more expressive language takes
  longer to learn, but it's easier to pass on subtle shades of meaning to
  the maintenance programmer (possibly yourself).
</pre>
<p>
<p>I think of Scheme as being both extremely simple and extremely expressive,<br />
while I think of a language like Java as being very complex but not very<br />
expressive. I would be more likely to say: &quot;But, a more rigid language<br />
is not as expressive.&quot; And to me, rigidity is much more likely to<br />
result from complexity than simplicity.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://www.testing.com">Brian Marick</a> writes about a <a
href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2004/04/12#automock">little-known<br />
feature</a> of the Ruby language: the ability to automatically mock classes<br />
for testing at runtime. There is a keyword called &quot;mock&quot; that you<br />
can use to do it. For example, if you want to temporarily replace the<br />
behavior of a class called <tt>MyDatabaseConnector</tt> for a test, you<br />
would use the following code:</p>
<pre>
  mock MyDatabaseConnector
  class ClassToMockWith
    ..code...
  end
</pre>
<p>
<p>Whatever class definition directly succeeds the invocation of<br />
&quot;<tt>mock</tt>&quot; will be temporarily substituted for the class<br />
specified as an argument to &quot;<tt>mock</tt>&quot;. Specifically, in<br />
this case, any references to MyDatabaseConnector will be replaced with<br />
references to ClassToMockWith, so instantiating MyDatabaseConnector<br />
actually instantiates ClassToMockWith, and so on.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Rubyists reading this are probably thinking I&#8217;ve lost my mind,<br />
because this isn&#8217;t really a feature of the Ruby language. It&#8217;s<br />
just a simple (albeit powerful) extension that Brian has written. But, to<br />
someone coming from a history of work exclusively done in in one or more of<br />
the more static languages (Java, C#, etc.), it looks like a first-class<br />
part of the language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is what Guy Steele was talking about in his <a

  <div class="article-content"><p>Avi and I were talking about <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3257728961">this<br />
post</a> &#8212;specifically <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView">James&#8217;s</a> comment,<br />
which says that Avi should consider including a templating engine in <a
href="http://www.beta4.com/seaside2/">Seaside</a> to avoid making newcomers<br />
feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>
<p>I had the following to say (&quot;lusers&quot; refers to the Dick Gabriel<br />
saying that Avi quotes in his post):</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/SeasideConversation.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(The ultimate in weblogging laziness.)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The qmail reference might elude some of you. <a
href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/johnson/">Ralph</a> walked us through<br />
qmail&#8217;s code at the <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA">Software<br />
<span class="caps">MFA</span> Program</a> in January. qmail does some really unorthodox things with<br />
IO streams, quickly alerting the reader (of the code) to the fact they<br />
aren&#8217;t in Kansas anymore.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>My <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA/Craft+Elements">&#8220;craft element&#8221;</a><br />
remark refers to the possibility that this kind of forced discomfort<br />
(dissonance) may be a trick-of-the-trade that developers can deliberately<br />
take advantage of.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>From this perspective, throwing templates into Seaside would be something<br />
like Gyorgy Ligeti ending <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/clipserve/B00005Y34N001002/0/104-2481148-3195168">Atmospheres</a><br />

  <div class="article-content"><p>Congratulations, <a

<a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/News/Jolt2004.html,v">Andy</a>. Nice<br />
to see someone make a courageous move and have it pay off.</p>
<p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t read these books yet (and you&#8217;re a software<br />
developer), you really should do yourself a favor and make the time.<br />
Don&#8217;t let &quot;Starter&quot; in the title fool you. Sure, the books<br />
are about fundamental and could be used as a &quot;starter kit&quot; (as<br />
the name suggests). But, greatness is (almost always) built on strong<br />
fundamentals, and you&#8217;re never too good to need more practice.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Richard Monson-Haefel <a
href="http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/1125">writes</a> about how <a
href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is being proposed as an<br />
&quot;official&quot; language for the <span class="caps">JVM</span>. It would definitely be nice to<br />
have a dynamic language &quot;officially&quot; supported on the <span class="caps">JVM</span> by Sun.<br />
I might even sneak it into a project or two while nobody&#8217;s looking.</p>
<p>
<p>But the thing that really caught my attention was this excerpt from the<br />
&quot;Why Groovy?&quot; rationale, defending its choice over <a
href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> or <a
href="http://jruby.sf.net">JRuby</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  ..is the best choice because it was built from the ground up for
  the Java Platform and uses syntax that is familiar to Java developers..
</pre>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn</a> and I were chatting a<br />
couple of mornings ago about AppleScript and how it&#8217;s said to be<br />
&quot;easy to use&quot;, because it&#8217;s so much like English. The<br />
problem, though, is that it looks like English and feels like English (sort<br />
of), but it&#8217;s <b>not</b> English. My brain wants it to be English and<br />
I end up typing English phrases into the editor that don&#8217;t parse.<br />
Incidentally, as someone who is very familiar with Java, I have the same<br />
problem on occasion with JavaScript (<a
href="http://wiki.codehaus.org/groovy/WhatsWrongWithJavaScript">here&#8217;s<br />
why</a> you should use Groovy instead of JavaScript). It confused me<br />
because it looked like Java, but it wasn&#8217;t Java.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The point of adding Groovy as an &quot;officially&quot; supported language<br />
for the <span class="caps">JVM</span> would be to allow programmers to think and do things<br />
differently than they can with the Java language. If the language is so<br />
semantically different, why struggle to make it syntactically similar? Why<br />
not let a different thing actually <b>look</b> different?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be uncomfortable on occasion. It shows you that<br />
you&#8217;re growing.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Since coming back from the MFASoftware program, I&#8217;ve been trying to<br />
stay focused on my remote assignments. I&#8217;ve been doing a<br />
particularily bad job of actually finishing anything, but I <b>have</b><br />
been learning a lot.</p>
<p>
<p>One of my assignments was to read and annotate Guy Steele&#8217;s Lambda<br />
The Ultimate Imperative (<a
href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">library.readscheme.org/page1.html</a>).<br />
I&#8217;ve read the paper twice and opened up an editor to write about it<br />
five or six times. As I read the paper, I knew it was teaching me something<br />
that was going to have a lasting effect, but somehow when I sat to write<br />
about it, the only memories I could summon were the mechanics of Scheme<br />
(which the paper is written in/using).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been learning Scheme in parallel to reading this paper, and<br />
I&#8217;ve definitely felt a lot of &quot;schemisms&quot; snap into place<br />
as I read. But I know that simply learning the language isn&#8217;t what<br />
this paper is about. It&#8217;s just so hard to separate learning the<br />
language from discovering the purity and simplicity of what Steele is<br />
demonstrating. The beauty of Scheme is that there&#8217;s hardly anything<br />
to it. To see Steele effortlessly implement programming constructs on top<br />
of this near-nothingness drives home the power of minimalism.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, now I realise that, above all else, it&#8217;s a fascination with<br />
minimalism that I&#8217;ve brought home from Illinois. <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3254253382">Apparently</a>,<br />
I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If minimalism is good, then what&#8217;s the opposite of minimalism?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I studied music composition with <a
href="http://www.kamranince.com">Kamran_Ince</a>, there was one thing I<br />
always knew he was going to say when I walked into his office with a new<br />
composition. He was going to tell me something like, &quot;You&#8217;ve got<br />
such a great idea here. Why do you have to run away from it so quickly? You<br />
didn&#8217;t develop it. We didn&#8217;t even know it happened!&quot; I<br />
would literally walk in to the beginning of a lesson <tt>knowing</tt> this<br />
was going to happen, and yet it would happen every time. It felt a little<br />
like not being able to spell &quot;<span class="caps">FBI</span>&quot; or like being given the<br />
answers to a test and then failing it anyway.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Though he wasn&#8217;t necessarily trying to encourage me to write music in<br />
the style of a minimalist, the lesson was in fact about minimalism as a<br />
craft element. And, if minimalism is good, then what I was bringing to<br />
Kamran each week was its opposite. Lots of good ideas, jammed into a very<br />
tiny temporal space. The end result was a jumble of intelligent thoughts,<br />
stepping all over each other so that none were ultimately recognizable.<br />
Have you tried to use <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/"><span class="caps">JDNI</span></a>? It was<br />
probably the musical equivalent. In the software world, this has the effect<br />
of both muddying up what is already there, and creating an environment that<br />
is unfriendly to extension and change.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the thing called &quot;minimalism&quot; in<br />
art-forms other than music. But, in music, one of minimalism&#8217;s key<br />
features is that of emergence. When players are making repetitive and<br />
rhythmic sounds, a la <a href="http://terryriley.com">Terry</a> <a
href="http://terryriley.com/">Reilly</a>, it&#8217;s almost never the<br />
<b>written</b> notes and rhythms that are interesting. It&#8217;s what<br />
happens when they&#8217;re all played together by imperfect humans.<br />
It&#8217;s the slow and subtle phase shifting, and then the<br />
musicians&#8217; subtle reactions to the phase shifting.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Scheme obviously creates an environment that encourages emergent behaviors.<br />
In fact, the whole point of Lambda the Ultimate Imperative (LtUI) is to<br />
show that Scheme can be an imperative language, without changing Scheme and<br />
without &quot;shoe-horning&quot; Scheme to awkwardly meet the imperative<br />
critera. LtUI happens to be written by one of Scheme&#8217;s designers, but<br />
there&#8217;s no reason you or I couldn&#8217;t have written that paper<br />
(other than my age at its time of publication).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, back to Kamran Ince. He was trying to teach me not just to keep my<br />
music simple so I could develop ideas. He was also trying to teach me to<br />
create powerful ideas. You can&#8217;t write music the &quot;Kamran<br />
Way&quot; while making timid gestures. If you&#8217;re going to let it all<br />
hang out with an idea, it better be strong.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And, with music, I think it&#8217;s a lot more apparent (than in<br />
programming) that you can&#8217;t start with an idea that doesn&#8217;t<br />
provide a platform on which to build a piece. For a patently contrived<br />
example, listen to <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/music/ThatsAllFolks.mp3">this</a>. It would be<br />
possible to build a piece of music on something that sounds so final, but<br />
it would sound strange and intentional. While the temporal element is<br />
missing, an extremely rigid language or an <span class="caps">API</span> that is too large and<br />
complex can produce the same effect of stunted idea growth in software. For<br />
(potentially inflamatory) example, if a method of an object can only accept<br />
parameters of a certain class, my freedoms are extremely and intentionally<br />
limited when using that object.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, &quot;good minimalism&quot; doesn&#8217;t require simply that we<br />
&quot;be minimal&quot;. It requires that we correctly balance substance and<br />
space in a way that encourages evolutionary growth. It is possible to be<br />
minimal and rigid, which will lead to small ideas that can&#8217;t be<br />
developed any further. This is rarely what we want. Minimalism is one of<br />
these words (like &quot;simple&quot;) that sound easy to do but actually<br />
require a lot of practice to get them right.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I see now that Lisp and Scheme aren&#8217;t different because of their<br />
minimal syntax or their dynamism. It&#8217;s the fact that they &quot;get<br />
out of the way&quot;, providing the right balance of mechanism and policy<br />
to allow their users to continue to evolve in the direction that nature<br />
selects, while not being so austere that wheels are necessariliy being<br />
reinvented every day. This is what has drawn me to Ruby (and Smalltalk and<br />
Scheme) and away from the likes of Java and C#. Not dynamic vs. static<br />
typing or compiled vs. interpreted environments.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Many of the arguments for and against these minimal environments seem to<br />
boil down to the Mechanism vs. Policy <a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/MechPolicy.rdoc">tradeoff</a>.<br />
But, I&#8217;ll leave that for a later post.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Dave has posted a clever piece of <a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Ruby/LazyType.rdoc">code</a>,<br />
showing how you could do runtime class checking in Ruby (or a Ruby-like<br />
language) by simply wrapping methods and recording the first class that is<br />
used for each method parameter. In his example, he uses it to throw an<br />
error if any subsequent invocation has a parameter of a class different<br />
from the first usage of that parameter. So, the following would fail:</p>
<pre>
  bob.age = 32
  bob.age = Duck.new
</pre>
<p>
<p>Though he warns that this is just a &quot;coffee-break<br />
implementation&quot;, the actual code is remarkably simple as well. I<br />
consider this to be a hallmark of Dave&#8217;s.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As anyone in the dynamic programming languages world knows, &quot;type<br />
checking&quot;(1) is a touchy and usually unproductive subject (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/RubyTypesAndClasses.rdoc,v">RubyTypesAndClasses</a>).<br />
The common complaint is that, without &quot;type&quot; information for<br />
method parameters, code is hard to understand and maintain. I don&#8217;t<br />
generally find this to be true for myself, but I can see and understand<br />
that sometimes it would be helpful to have some hints as to what kinds of<br />
objects a library author passes into certain method calls.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The simplest solution to this&#8212;which wouldn&#8217;t require a<br />
compromise of the design philosophy of the language&#8212;would be for all<br />
library authors to simply document their code, giving their users a hint as<br />
to what each method expects. We&#8217;ve all heard that one before. Even<br />
those of us with the best intentions do, on average, a poor job documenting<br />
our own code. Additionally, what&#8217;s obvious to me may not be obvious<br />
to you. So as a library author, I will probably either overdocument (waste<br />
my own time and clutter the code) or underdocument.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Taking a cue from Dave, I did my own coffee-break implementation(2) of a<br />
hack that would auto-document the class of parameters for a given set of<br />
methods. It&#8217;s implemented as a modification to <a
href="http://rdoc.sf.net">rdoc</a>. The idea is that you can<br />
&quot;instrument&quot; your code temporarily, run through a typical usage<br />
of it, and have Ruby keep track of&#8212;and save&#8212;class information<br />
for the method parameters of specified classes.</p>
</p>
<h2>An example</h2>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a servlet (which I&#8217;ll talk about in more detail in<br />
a later post) that I would like to document via rdoc. Assuming the servlet<br />
is called &quot;ContinuationServlet&quot;, I can auto-generate parameter<br />
class hints for this servlet by adding the following to my code:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'class_hints'
  wrap_methods(ContinuationServlet)
  ...
  (invoke webrick normally here)
  ...
  File.open(&amp;quot;seasidehints.out&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;w&amp;quot;) do |file|
    file.write(Marshal::dump(Kernel::METHOD_PARAM_HINTS))
  end
</pre>
<p>
<p>This will install a wrapper around every method of ContinuationServlet,<br />
which will save class information for each parameter in the nested hash,<br />
Kernel::METHOD_PARAM_HINTS. After having clicked around through the<br />
application with a web browser, we just dump this to disk as a marshalled<br />
Ruby object.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Next, we feed this hash to rdoc when we document:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  rdoc --param-hint-file=seasidehints.out pm_seaside.rb
</pre>
<p>
<p>You can see the output <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/lazyseaside/doc/">here</a>. For the lazy,<br />
documented methods now look something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  call_cont([Continuation]cont, [WEBrick::HTTPUtils::FormData]answer)
</pre>
<p>
<p>Full code listing:</p>

</p>
<p>
<p>Like Dave, I&#8217;m just throwing this up here for comment. I&#8217;m not<br />
sure anyone will find it useful, and the implementation is definitely a<br />
hack. But, it seems like something <ins>like this</ins> might help to quiet some of<br />
the complaints that half the population seems to have about dynamically<br />
typed languages. And, for example, could <a
href="http://freeride.rubyforge.org">FreeRIDE</a> use a trick like this to<br />
provide intellisense-like hints in the <span class="caps">IDE</span>?</p>
</p>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>(1) The word &quot;type&quot; is frequently misused in the Ruby world to<br />
mean &quot;class&quot;. Matz actually deprecated the #type message on<br />
Object to clarify that a Ruby object&#8217;s &quot;type&quot; is more<br />
focused on its capabilities than its class. Class is little more than a<br />
convenience mechanism.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(2) It was a pretty long coffee break :)</p>
