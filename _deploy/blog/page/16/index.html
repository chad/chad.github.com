  <div class="article-content"><p>We&#8217;ve just released another <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html">Rails<br />
Recipes</a> beta. This release features contributions from three of the<br />
incredibly talented <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">Rails core team<br />
members</a>: <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olson</a> (congrats,<br />
Rick!), <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a>, and <a
href="http://vernix.org/marcel/">Marcel Molina, Jr.</a>. These guys are not<br />
only gifted programmers but gifted writers and teachers as well.</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to watch the framework evolve, and writing this book<br />
has given me a chance to witness and document the bleeding edge as it<br />
happens. As a result, I&#8217;ve been able to cover a lot of the features<br />
in the upcoming Rails 1.1 release, for which there really is no other<br />
source of documentation right now.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The <a href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes">forum</a> we <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/DiscussRailsRecipes.rdoc,v">opened<br />
last week</a> has been a wonderful source of ideas and inspiration. Thanks<br />
a <em>ton</em> to everyone who has signed up and contributed. Specifically<br />
notable are the two recipes <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes/write-your-own">created by<br />
readers</a>:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.apptrain.org/">Mike Blake</a> posted a <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes/write-your-own/post/42">really<br />
useful recipe</a> on backing up your data using <a
href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">Rake</a> and ActiveRecord fixtures.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://sl33p3r.free.fr/blog">Frederick Ros</a> then followed up<br />
with an <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes/write-your-own/post/84">excellent<br />
recipe</a> on using ActiveRecord with legacy databases that have their<br />
<em>own</em> conventions.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As authors for the Ruby community, we&#8217;re blessed with a<br />
super-intelligent audience for our books. No doubt that readers are<br />
learning from <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html">Rails<br />
Recipes</a>, but Rails Recipes is also learning from its readers.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Finally, <span class="caps">CONGRATULATIONS</span> to <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David</a><br />
and <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Dave and Andy</a> for<br />
<em>cleaning</em> <em>house</em> on the <a
href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/pressroom/jolt_finalists_2006.html">16th<br />
Annual Jolt Awards</a>. The Jolt Awards are kind of like the Grammys or the<br />
Oscars of our industry. Dave and Andy <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/PragmaticJoltAward.rdoc,v">won<br />
once before</a>. Pretty amazing for a young publishing house to win twice<br />
in three years!</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>To celebrate another beta release of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a><br />
today, we&#8217;ve opened up a <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes">discussion forum</a> (powered<br />
by the wonderful new <a
href="http://home.leetsoft.com/opinion">Opinion</a>) for readers to post<br />
ideas, suggestions, <em>success</em> <em>stories</em> (please!) and even<br />
their own recipes. Thousands of people are reading and using the book to<br />
solve <em>real</em> <em>problems</em>, and we wanted to give them each a<br />
voice.</p>
<p>
<p>There have been so many great recipe suggestions showing up in my inbox<br />
every day, that I didn&#8217;t want to keep them all for myself. A lot of<br />
those suggestions will make it into the book. Others won&#8217;t simply due<br />
to the volume. But the recipe format is obviously resonating with people,<br />
so there&#8217;s no reason we shouldn&#8217;t turn those ideas into helpful<br />
documentation.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>From now on, instead of sending your ideas to me directly, let&#8217;s<br />
start a <a href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes">discussion</a><br />
that everyone can benefit from.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Tell everyone:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>What cool stuff you did with the recipes in the book</li>
<li>How you expanded on the ideas presented</li>
<li>Problems you had that you need help with</li>
<li>Problems you had that you can help others with</li>
<li>Or just give us your ideas and suggestions for the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>The book is still in development, so this is a good chance to have an<br />
impact on a book that will shape how the Rails community approaches its<br />
problems from now into the future.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>James Gosling, father of the <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000568.html">Java programming<br />
language</a>, <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146.htm">thinks Ruby<br />
is just for generating web pages</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>He&#8217;s wrong of course, but you already knew that.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What&#8217;s notable here isn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s wrong and we need to<br />
defend Ruby from his ignorance. What&#8217;s notable is that the<br />
<em>guy</em> who&#8217;s supposed to be carrying Java forward is completely<br />
clueless about the <em>real</em> competition. My guess is that he<br />
completely understands the challenges C# brings. It&#8217;s easy to<br />
understand. It&#8217;s just like Java.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If this is who Sun has driving their language and platform strategy, Java<br />
may not be the conservative choice of programming technology (for long)<br />
that you might believe it to be.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been remiss in not mentioning this, but I want to give regular readers a chance before it&#8217;s too late:  On April 10, I&#8217;ll be conducting a <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course?PHPSESSID=2f48bcd3554fd02b0689858f3ef05e37">4 day Ruby on Rails</a> training session for <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skill Matter</a>, a UK-based training firm.<br />

<p><br/>
We&#8217;re limiting the class to <i>twelve</i> total seats, so it won&#8217;t feel like a big class where nobody knows each other and nobody gets personal attention.  We&#8217;re aiming for a heavily hands-on session, and we&#8217;ll be digging into some of the darker corners that you would normally have to first face on your own.  With only twelve students in the class, you won&#8217;t be just another face in the crowd.  So come with your questions and your own problems to solve.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
The down side of having twelve seats available is that they&#8217;re going to go fast.  With <a href="http://www.railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> <a href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/08/railsconf-is-sold-out">selling out 400 seats</a> in <b>under a week</b>, it&#8217;s no secret that people are hungry to learn about Rails.  Spaces are already going, so if you have to get managerial approvals or fight with your human resources department, you should get started as soon as you can.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
Along with the basics of Ruby and Rails, I&#8217;ll be covering Rails 1.1 features and many tips and tricks that I&#8217;ve been collecting as I write <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Rails Recipes</a>.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you in London!</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Last night we released the first beta of my new book, <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a>.<br />
For those that don&#8217;t know, a Pragmatic <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/beta_faq.html">Beta<br />
Book</a> lets you read the book as it&#8217;s being <em>written</em>.<br />
I&#8217;m about a third of the way through, but there&#8217;s already a lot<br />
of helpful content in the book, and with the beta process, the book will<br />
grow in its owners&#8217; hands as it&#8217;s developed.</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/conversational_.html">easy<br />
to read</a> walkthroughs of <em>advanced</em> Rails topics, this is the<br />
book for you. If you&#8217;ve read <a

Ruby</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web<br />
Development With Rails</a>, this book is the logical next step.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking suggestions for Recipes, so if you get in early, your<br />
recipe idea might just make it into the book.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I stayed up late last night opening up <a
href="http://railsconf.org/">RailsConf registration</a>. Before I even got<br />
the time to post about it here, we&#8217;re well on our way to <a
href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/02/02/railsconf-2006-selling-fast">selling<br />
out</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>RailsConf is going to be <em>the</em> conference to go to this year.<br />
We&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/keynotes/">keynote<br />
lineup</a> so amazing I can hardly believe it. We have over 80 high quality<br />
talk proposals to pick from, so the main session content is guaranteed to<br />
be incredible. We&#8217;re planning panel discussions with the <a
href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">Rails Core team</a>, and time for<br />
self-organizing activities.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But I think the thing I&#8217;m most proud of, which I can&#8217;t take any<br />
credit for, is the <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook">Rails<br />
Guidebook</a>. What if you were excited about a technology and really<br />
wanted to attend a conference to learn about it, but you thought the<br />
sessions might all be over your head? How would you prepare yourself to<br />
make sure you got the most out of the experience?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>How about getting the <a href="http://www.pragmaticstudio.com">top<br />
instructors in the field</a> to give you a one-day immersion, covering<br />
everything you need to know to feel like an <em>insider</em> at the<br />
conference? That&#8217;s what the Rails Guidebook is. Dave Thomas and Mike<br />
Clark, of the Pragmatic Studio, are going to be laying all the groundwork<br />
you might need all day on June 22.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Members of the Rails Core team and the RubyGems team will be onsite for an<br />
install fest, that will get you and your laptop all set up to experiment<br />
and create during the conference.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And all you have to do to attend the Guidebook session (aside from<br />
registering for the conference itself) is to donate money to one or more of<br />
a <a
href="http://www.justgive.org/basket?donorId=42670&listTypeId=1&acton=viewList">predefined<br />
list of charities</a>. The minimum requested donation is $40 US, but<br />
we&#8217;ve already seen people exceed that by leaps and bounds. It&#8217;s<br />
exciting to see people giving so generously in the name of Ruby and Rails.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When the Guidebook fills up (and that&#8217;s going to happen<br />
<em>soon</em>), I would love to see the giving continue. Dave and Mike will<br />
be announcing how much we as a community have raised at RailsConf. So even<br />
if you&#8217;re not going to attend the Guidebook session&#8212;or even<br />
RailsConf&#8212;help <a
href="http://www.justgive.org/basket?donorId=42670&listTypeId=1&acton=viewList">make<br />
the community proud</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put another <em>insanely</em> <em>great</em> <a
href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/02/01/secrets-behind-ruby-on-rails-the-numbers">number<br />
on the map</a> for the Ruby community.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Fellow Arkansan Josh McAdams was recently kind enough to <a

me</a> for <a href="http://perlcast.com/">Perlcast</a>, the Perl<br />
community&#8217;s equivalent to the <a

</p>
<p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a fun bit of the interview, taken out of context:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  Perlcast:  This is Perlcast, so I have to ask:  Is Perl a safe language to
  be an expert in?

  Me: Absolutely not. ... If Perl was going to be your only language right
  now, then I would be terrified.  If you identify yourself as a Perl
  programmer, then I would be terrified.
</pre>
<p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to listen to the whole thing to hear the<br />
<em>shocking</em> conclusion.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>From a semi-recent <a
href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/theres-so-much-more-than-rails.html">post</a><br />
by Python programmer Ian Bicking:</p>
<pre>
  You can monkeypatch code in Python pretty easily, but we look down
  on it enough that we call it &amp;quot;monkeypatching&amp;quot;. In Ruby they call it
  &amp;quot;opening a class&amp;quot; and think it's a cool feature.
  I will assert: we are right, they are wrong.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Today, I was frustrated by a Rails bug affecting pagination with joins. In<br />
short, it doesn&#8217;t work. At all.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Miraculously, (no, it wasn&#8217;t a coincidence&#8212;it was an actual<br />
miracle) <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark</a> posted a message to<br />
the Rails Core list <em>right</em> in the middle of this episode<br />
complaining about the exact same problem. He said he was working on a fix.<br />
<a href="http://jthopple.com/">Jeremy Hopple</a> responded a little over an hour later saying that he had<br />
already submitted a <a
href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/2597">patch</a> for the bug.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Visions of the nasty download/patch process started trudging through my<br />
mind, but I was desperate for a fix so I would have dealt with the<br />
ugliness. I hate hacking my local Rails (I&#8217;m running off of trunk<br />
using svn:externals) because I don&#8217;t like dealing with what happens<br />
when the change actually gets applied to trunk or dealing with merges for<br />
other changes to the same files. It&#8217;s not rocket science to get<br />
working but it&#8217;s also not fun.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Looking more closely at Jeremy&#8217;s email, he&#8217;s also distributing<br />
his patch as a Rails plugin. So:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  $ ruby script/plugin install count_limit_assocations
</pre>
<p>
<p>Now my code works. The bug is fixed. The plugin contains essentially<br />
nothing but a file that &quot;monkey patches&quot; some of the Rails core<br />
classes, implementing the changed version of the code.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When the change is merged into the Rails trunk, I&#8217;ll just<br />
&#8216;script/plugin remove&#8217; Jeremy&#8217;s plugin.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Rails team is already using plugins like this as a way to get new<br />
functionality into circulation as a kind of proving ground before things<br />
make it into Rails core. And as we see today, it&#8217;s also a simple,<br />
painless way to get fixes distributed before they&#8217;re reviewed and<br />
committed. Sure, you can do the more obvious thing with plugins and<br />
distribute code that implements new functionality altogether. But this<br />
&quot;monkey patching&quot; thing is seriously powerful and, as an end-usre<br />
in this case, I can say that it makes things better for the <em>users</em><br />
of Ruby.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So Ian, with respect, no&#8230;you&#8217;re not right.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: Ian sent me the following clarification by email (reprinted with<br />
permission&#8212;thanks Ian!):</p>

  Hi Chad.  Saw your post on monkeypatching.  Just thought I'd clarify
  that I don't think that kind of use is wrong, and I do that frequently
  -- applying a patch at runtime to the objects in memory, instead of the
  source code on disk.  It can be expedient, and certainly a whole lot
  better than trading patches around.  The use I object to that I see in
  lots of Ruby examples (and maybe isn't indicative of most real Ruby
  code) is when people add methods to other classes that aren't meant to
  fix anything, but just because they don't have an object of their own to
  hang the method off of.  I've seen several examples where people add
  methods to Array to implement some recursive algorithm, instead of using
  a function.  Or Rails adding methods to numbers to create time delta
  objects (well, it would be good if they *were* time delta objects, but I
  understand they actually just return seconds as ints, but that's another
  issue entirely).

  The term &amp;quot;monkeypatch&amp;quot; is really meant to denote that.  It's a patch, a
  fix, an adjustment to the code.  The monkey part has a history (that
  someone left on my post) that I think more-or-less is meant to indicate
  a certain subversive intent, or at least playfully but maybe mischievous
  manipulation.  We do it often in Python, but everytime we do it we know
  we are working around the system and not with it.  Which is fine too,
  but it's not the sort of thing you want as a foundation.

  <div class="article-content"><p>Last week I flew to Montreal to keynote at <a
href="http://cusec.soen.info/"><span class="caps">CUSEC</span></a>. Mine was the opening keynote,<br />
titled <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/FightTheTraffic.rdoc,v">Fight<br />
The Traffic</a>. Other keynotes were to include <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> and <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.<br />
Unfortunately David ended up getting snowed in, so I also gave the closing<br />
keynote, which I called &quot;Rails is Boring, and Ruby is a Toy&quot;, and<br />
in which I described some of the salient philosophical features of Ruby and<br />
Rails and encouraged their application in other (less fortunate?) software<br />
environments.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="caps">CUSEC</span> is a wonderful conference. It&#8217;s arranged by Canadian software<br />
engineering students <em>for</em> software engineering students. The talks<br />
were engaging, and like most conferences, the in-between-session<br />
discussions were especially inspirational. The <span class="caps">CUSEC</span> organizers wooed me<br />
with the promise of speaking to the future of software development in<br />
Canada, and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. These were some smart,<br />
<em>passionate</em> kids.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It was my first chance to see Kathy&#8217;s <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7077">Creating<br />
Passionate Users</a> talk, which I can&#8217;t recommend more strongly. It<br />
will affect the way <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">I write</a>, work,<br />
and <em>consume</em> from now on. She&#8217;s got a book coming out in the<br />
not-too-distant future on the topic. I&#8217;m convinced that it will<br />
become and remain a classic.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I was particularly fond of my slides for the talk. I can say that without<br />
fear of sounding conceited, because I didn&#8217;t make them myself. My<br />
friend and cothinker, <a href="http://steveakers.blogspot.com/">Steve<br />
Akers</a> worked with me to <em>draw</em> the slides for my talk by<br />
<em>hand</em>. What follows is the title slide, but the rest are available<br />
on his site, <a href="http://www.moebot.com">Moe Bot</a>. Check &#8216;em<br />
out. You can also <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MoeBot">subscribe to<br />
his pictures via <span class="caps">RSS</span></a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/fight-the-traffic.png"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The sessions were recorded, so I&#8217;ll post a link when they&#8217;re<br />
available. On the mp3, you&#8217;ll be able to hear me make wretched noises<br />
on my soprano saxophone. Stay tuned. You won&#8217;t want to miss that.</p>
