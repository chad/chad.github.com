  Delicious is a social bookmarks manager.
</pre>
<p>
<p>You can subscribe to my bookmarks and I can subscribe to yours. These are<br />
available via <span class="caps">RSS</span> or <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to mention this for a while, but it hasn&#8217;t<br />
been &quot;officially&quot; public until sometime fairly recently. Joshua<br />
(<a href="http://burri.to/~joshua/">burri.to/~joshua/</a>), who developed<br />
del.icio.us, is also the creator of memepool (<a
href="http://memepool.com/">memepool.com/</a>) and GeoURL (<a
href="http://geourl.org/">geourl.org/</a>).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a similar idea for some time but with some extended<br />
statistical analysis features which Joshua insists would be too difficult<br />
to actually implement if I tried. So, instead I&#8217;ll just start using<br />
his and see where it leads.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s really convenient, in that you can create bookmarks using a<br />
simple del.icio.us bookmarklet.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What&#8217;s going to be more interesting than the basic<br />
functionality&#8212;it&#8217;s a very simple idea really&#8212;is the<br />
network effect of how people, links, and categories&#8217; interactions<br />
emerge into clusters and metatopics.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Also, wouldn&#8217;t you love to have a running list of the stuff your<br />
&quot;heroes&quot; are reading and finding intersting enough to bookmark? I<br />
can think of a handful of software developers whose moves I would love to<br />
track. What are the seeds that are going to grow the next big innovations<br />
or the New Thinking about software development? Perhaps some of them might<br />
show up in these lists.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Of course, as this grows it may become too eclectic for anyone to find<br />
interesting as a flat, running, aggregated list. Somehow this needs to<br />
become &quot;social&quot; at a different level and evolve into communities<br />
(to be fair, Joshua warns on the site, &quot;This system is pre-pre-alpha;<br />
many features have yet to be added. Additionally, many, many bugs remain.<br />
Please be careful.&quot;). Artima (<a
href="http://www.artima.com/buzz/index.jsp">www.artima.com/buzz/index.jsp</a>)<br />
attempts to do this in a very limited way with its &quot;Buzz&quot;<br />
feature. But, with Artima&#8217;s application, you have to choose a single<br />
category that your posts will fit into, and it&#8217;s obviously hard to<br />
find a category that <b>always</b> works.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I wonder if you could apply Vector Space Search (<a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html">www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html</a>)<br />
to this problem to auto-clump bookmarks or people into categories.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>OK. Now go sign up (<a
href="http://del.icio.us/register">del.icio.us/register</a>) at del.icio.us<br />
so I can subscribe to your bookmarks. You can see mine here (<a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jim has posted a nice series of notes about the goings-on at RubyConf: <a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rich (<a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether">richkilmer.blogs.com/ether</a>),<br />
Jim (<a href="http://onestepback.org">onestepback.org</a>), and I are<br />
decompressing in the Austin airport, taking advantage of some Wi-fi access<br />
and waiting for our flights. As I warned in a previous post, my posting<br />
during the conference would require some very special planetary alignment.<br />
It didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>
<p>However, I was able to login to irc from Matz&#8217;s keynote to braindump<br />
into the #ruby-lang channel (on freenode.net) about upcoming Ruby language<br />
changes. I won&#8217;t go too much into detail here, but Horacio Lopez (<a
href="http://ruby-es.org">ruby-es.org</a>) reformatted and posted it all on<br />
the Wiki (<a
href="http://rubygarden.org/ruby?Rite">rubygarden.org/ruby?Rite</a>). There<br />
are some fairly major incompatabilities on the way, but overall<br />
they&#8217;re going to make the language just that much better.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The conference, as usual, as a great experience. It&#8217;s great to get<br />
together with that many smart and creative people all at once. This year,<br />
we&#8217;ve done something I&#8217;ve been wanting to do since 2001: We<br />
wrote code. Friday night, during the round table with Matz, David Black (<a
href="http://wobblini.net">wobblini.net</a>) brought up the age-old<br />
question of standardizing ruby package installation procedures. After the<br />
round table, he, Rich, Jim, Paul (<a
href="http://rubystuff.org">rubystuff.org</a>), and I spent the rest of the<br />
weekend crash-coding in whatever free time we could find and creating that<br />
standardized distribution system. It is based on an idea that was<br />
introduced at the first Ruby Conference, and has also adopted that<br />
idea&#8217;s name: RubyGems (<a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems">rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems</a>).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>We must have been quite a spectacle to the hipsters in the hotel bar, with<br />
our laptops and ad-hoc network. We coded long into the night. The end<br />
result is that during today&#8217;s talks, Jim showed how you can create<br />
working Rake (<a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">rake.rubyforge.org</a>)<br />
tasks for creating and installing gems, and Rich actually installed<br />
RubyJDWP as a gem &quot;live on stage&quot; for his RubyJDWP (<a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyjdwp">rubyforge.org/projects/rubyjdwp</a>)<br />
talk. We were also able to get remote installation and dependency<br />
management working (though not perfectly) before we left, including a<br />
&quot;gem server&quot; which you can use to serve ruby packages to others<br />
who have the right client-side tools.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Ruby community has been talking about this for years. It was nice to<br />
just say, &quot;Let&#8217;s do it <b>now</b>&quot; while we had Matz and a<br />
great core group of Ruby programmers handy to give us requirements, answer<br />
questions, etc. For example, it was really nice when Paul and I had a<br />
problem with Test::Unit to say, &quot;Nathaniel, what does this message<br />
mean?&quot; (Nathaniel wrote Test::Unit).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The only regret I have about RubyConf this year is that it can&#8217;t be<br />
what I do every day.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post some more details on the conference highlights after I get<br />
some real rest (which unfortunately might not be until Wednesday or<br />
Thursday). Excuse any typos and/or incoherencies until then&#8230; ;)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Update: Ryan Davis pointed out that I mispoke (I mentioned I was tired,<br />
right?) when I said that Matz&#8217;s presentation was on future language<br />
changes. He was really looking for feedback on a bunch of high level ideas.<br />
It was more of a brainstorming session than a presentation. This is<br />
important for two reasons. The first is that I don&#8217;t want to mislead<br />
anyone into thinking that Matz&#8217;s presentation represented fully baked<br />
ideas. The second, and more important, is just the very fact that Matz came<br />
to the community and asked for help. That&#8217;s really great if ya ask<br />
me.</p>

<p>
<p>A near flame-war has broken out on ruby-talk (<a
href="http://www.ruby-talk.org">www.ruby-talk.org</a>). But, amidst the<br />
smoldering remains lie some of the most clarifying statements I&#8217;ve<br />
seen about Ruby&#8217;s class/type system.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I have to admit that this thread struck one of my most sensitive nerves in<br />
the Ruby programming world these days: people coming from statically typed<br />
languages trying to force-fit dynamically typed languages into behaving<br />
like their previous languages (e.g. Java, C++, C#). Specifically, new Ruby<br />
programmers are constantly looking for how to &quot;document<br />
interfaces&quot; in some strict, contractual way. That&#8217;s fine with<br />
Java and C#, where it really means something, but in Ruby it&#8217;s<br />
meaningless to check the class of an object on method invocations. What<br />
makes it worse is that they show up crusading to save the &quot;loose<br />
typing&quot; heathens from the damnation that only strict, static typing<br />
can prevent. I probably sparked the initial flame of the near-war, with a<br />
post containing:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  As you can see, any code that that relies on this kind of &amp;quot;type checking&amp;quot;
  in Ruby is naive.  Worse than that, the desire to shoe-horn
  Ruby into Java-like &amp;quot;strictness&amp;quot; can blind the user into missing the
  point, and therefore the full benefit, of what Ruby has to offer.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Rich Kilmer (<a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/">richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/</a>)<br />
had the following to say about this static-ish type checking:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  The question is whether you write your methods to expect a certain
  &amp;quot;namespace&amp;quot; (Class/Module), or just simply a set of behaviors.
</pre>
<p>
<p>This is the first time I can remember someone referring to a class or<br />
module in Ruby as a &quot;namespace&quot; for collecting and grouping<br />
behaviors. That one sentence really cuts to the core of the matter. Great<br />
way to look at it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Austin Ziegler (<a href="http://halostatue.ca">halostatue.ca</a>) and David<br />
Black (<a
href="http://rubygarden.org/ruby?DavidBlack">rubygarden.org/ruby?DavidBlack</a>)<br />
joined in with a deluge of great points, with David (who is quickly<br />
becoming the defacto authority on this issue), specifically focusing on the<br />
type != class issue:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(excuse this being a little out of context)</p>
</p>
<pre>
  But I will want anonymous types, like:

     c = CGI.new
     c.extend(MyCGIModule)
     def c.another_method; ...; end

  The *class* of c is CGI, and the module/class *ancestry* of c is
  [MyCGIModule,CGI,Object,Kernel] (or something), but the *type* of c,
  Ruby being Ruby, is &amp;quot;the type which is the type of objects which have
  c's type&amp;quot;.  And that's just fine; there's no need for me to have a
  name for the type (since it's not encapsulated anywhere except in the
  interface of c anyway), as long as I design, test, and use c in a
  sensible manner.  I only needed the name of a class to bootstrap the
  object, and the name of a module to modify it.  Then type takes over.
</pre>
<p>
<p>So, to distill all this, Ruby has objects which have behaviors (in the form<br />
of methods). Methods are called via messages sent to objects. As a<br />
convenience, Ruby provides classes and modules as ways of grouping and<br />
categorizing semantically related behaviors.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I understood this topic before today, but as a result of this discussion, I<br />
feel like I understand it in a different and deeper way now.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in object oriented programming, whether<br />
you&#8217;re using a dynamically typed language or not, the thread is<br />
definitely worth a read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a
href="http://kirk.blog-city.com/read/309742.htm">kirk.blog-city.com/read/309742.htm</a></p>
<p>
<p>Kirk does a nice job of explaining what&#8217;s wrong with the way a lot of<br />
people approach software design patterns.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>His statement is hauntingly similar to the one I mentioned in <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/ValuelessSoftware.html,v">ValuelessSoftware</a>,<br />
which is why it caught my eye.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Interestingly, his observation applies equally to the &quot;patterns&quot;<br />
that jazz musicians use in their practice. Traditional jazz improvisation<br />
is all about trying to fit creative and spontaneous music composition on<br />
top of somewhat predictable chord progressions. Western music being as it<br />
is, you can quite easily abstract almost any &quot;chord change&quot; into<br />
its functional &quot;purpose&quot; (i.e. a II&#8212;2nd chord in a key,<br />
like D minor in the key of C major&#8212;followed by V usually function as<br />
the building of tension that leads to a I or the ultimate resolution).<br />
Because of this predictability and repetition in the chord progressions, it<br />
becomes easy to study the improvised solos of the masters and simply lift<br />
patterns of notes and apply them&#8212;properly transposed&#8212;in other<br />
instances of the same progression. &quot;If it worked for Charlie<br />
Parker.&#8230;&quot;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/Ayler.jpg"> <strong>Albert Ayler played<br />
no licks</strong></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The funny thing about these patterns, is that you can listen to novice jazz<br />
improvisors and very easily pick out where they&#8217;re being used. This<br />
is largely because of the emphasis they place on use of these patterns. You<br />
can feel their minds working in overdrive as they get closer to the point<br />
where they want to insert the pattern. Then, the more natural, though<br />
probably limp, musical phrase that they&#8217;re playing abruptly drops off<br />
into an awkward silent pause. The pattern is then very mechanically crammed<br />
over the next one or two measures, followed by a moment of silent relief<br />
and pride as the improvisor recovers from the stress of trying to apply the<br />
pattern and then struggles to regain his or her footing as the journey<br />
continues.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>With most jazz improvisors, you see the tendency to use patterns disappear<br />
over time. At first, they let go of the desire and then forced attempt to<br />
use the pattern that I describe above. Ultimately, individual patterns<br />
emerge and you only recognize these individual patterns in their playing<br />
(for the most part), with the old forced ones staying with Charlie Parker<br />
where they belong.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Incidentally, some of the best advice I ever received as a student of jazz<br />
improvisation came very unexpectedly from a teacher at the University of<br />
Memphis (<a
href="http://www.vtjazz.org/bios/rush.html">www.vtjazz.org/bios/rush.html</a>)<br />
during a class on improvisation. &quot;Stop playing the changes,<br />
dammit!&quot; This was an example of a truly great improvisor (you really<br />
should hear Gene play) telling a student not only to not try to play these<br />
melodic patterns, but to stop even being hindered by the patterns of chord<br />
changes that underly the improvisation. Just play.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In jazz, the patterns are worth studying and even practicing. But when you<br />
show up somewhere to play for someone else, you should allow their<br />
teachings to come through in your music instead of allowing the patterns<br />
themselves to come through. Otherwise, you&#8217;re just standing their<br />
playing a bunch of II-V-I licks. A computer can do that.</p>

<p>
<p>Three years ago tomorrow (my memory isn&#8217;t that good&#8212;I happened<br />
to make a web post about it), I finished reading what would turn out to be<br />
one of the most influential books of my computer programming career, The<br />
Pragmatic Programmer, by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas (<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com</a>).<br />
Since then, I&#8217;ve followed their articles, weblogs (see the links on<br />
the right) and like many others have anticipated the release of their next<br />
book.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Taking a surprising turn, they have recently announced the formation of<br />
their own publishing entity and have simultaneously released two new books.<br />
Today, my copies of &quot;Pragmatic Unit Testing&quot; and &quot;Pragmatic<br />
Version Control&quot; arrived.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>They seem to be catering to the future Pragmatic Programmer market with<br />
material of a more introductory nature. So, the material may be a bit on<br />
the basic side. This is why they are calling these books a<br />
&quot;prequel&quot; as opposed to a true follow-up to Pragmatic Programmer.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As long as there&#8217;s no mention of Jar Jar (<a
href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0120915/Ss/0120915/fcstil_1155.jpg?path=pgallery&path_key=Best,%20Ahmed">www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0120915/Ss/0120915/fcstil_1155.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Best,%20Ahmed</a>)<br />
I&#8217;ll be happy. And, you can never hear good advice too many times.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>While I obviously haven&#8217;t read these books yet, I&#8217;m going to go<br />
out on a limb and pre-recommend them to you in case you don&#8217;t know<br />
anything about them. If they&#8217;re even nearly as good as the first one,<br />
they will take their place in my list of require reading materials for any<br />
new programmer. <a

</p>
<p>
<p>(Incidentally, 3 years ago today was the day I first downloaded Ruby [<a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>]. This was actually<br />
also a result of reading The Pragmatic Programmer and the<br />
learn-one-language-per-year tip.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just occurred to me today that there&#8217;s only about one month left<br />
until the Third International Ruby Conference (<a
href="http://www.rubyconf.org">www.rubyconf.org</a>). Time to finalize<br />
little details like name tags and t-shirts.</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in programming&#8212;Ruby or not&#8212;this is a<br />
great conference to attend. The first conference (2001) was one of the best<br />
computer geek gatherings I&#8217;ve been to. We had language designers, XP<br />
people, and a bunch of really smart people with a bunch of really good<br />
ideas. You&#8217;re guaranteed to leave the conference with new found<br />
inspiration.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For some idea of what has gone on in the past:</p>

<p>Registration ends on October 24, but if you miss it you can still get<br />
in&#8212;foodless&#8212;by registering late or just showing up.</p>

<p>See you there?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brian and company are up to something very interesting: <a
href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2003/10/02#mfa">www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2003/10/02#mfa</a></p>
<p>
<p>If I were a hiring manager of software developers, this degree would<br />
definitely make a candidate more credible to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m in the minority. With software<br />
development shifting steadily toward commodity status (whether<br />
we&#8212;developers&#8212;like it or not), this kind of study opportunity<br />
might turn fill a very small niche. With the tuition that Richard Gabriel<br />
suggests ($15,000 &#8211; $20,000/semester), I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d have<br />
trouble justifying the expense based on potential <span class="caps">ROI</span>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I guess you have to look at the other arts as an exapmle in this case,<br />
though. People are still paying to go to music school or to learn painting<br />
or sculpture, even when the chances of making a good living in any of these<br />
fields are abysmal. So, this might in fact be the right time to introduce<br />
software as an art form into academia. You can&#8217;t really count on<br />
making much money on it, but you can definitely practice it and be<br />
expressive with it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>All this having been said, if there were an opportunity to participate in<br />
this program and I had the money (or&#8212;better&#8212;a scholarship) I<br />
would jump at the chance.</p>
