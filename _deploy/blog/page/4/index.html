  <div class="article-content">	<p>There&#8217;s an old joke I heard in India which goes something like this:</p>
	<p>What do you call a person who speaks many languages? <em>Multilingual</em></p>
	<p>What do you call a person who speaks two languages? <em>Bilingual</em></p>
	<p>What do you call a person who speaks one language? <em>American</em></p>
	<p>Sad, but usually true. I got fairly deep into my adult life without having learned anymore<br />
than the bare minimum Spanish I was required to study in the Arkansas public school system.<br />
As you might imagine, I wasn&#8217;t all that conversational in Spanish by the time I graduated.<br />
My father&#8217;s mother was German and my mother&#8217;s mother is Japanese. I grew up hearing many <br />
languages spoken but somehow never learned another one. As a German-Japanese-American, by my <br />
mid-20s I started to feel like I was missing something serious.</p>
	<p>I was sitting at work in a big company lunch room one day talking<br />
to an Indian friend. I asked how many languages he spoke and he said six.<br />
I told him I was envious and that I guessed I would need to just<br />
eventually move to another country so I could be immersed enough to<br />
learn a language. I was tired of being the typical monolingual American.<br />
 He said, &#8220;Look around. Anything significant about<br />
the people you see?&#8221; I looked around and it turned out I was the only<br />
person in the lunch room who wasn&#8217;t Indian. He said &#8220;Learn an Indian<br />
language&#8221;.</p>
	<p>So I bought every Hindi book, <span class="caps">CD <span class="caps">ROM</span></span>, and video I could find and<br />
started watching Bollywood movies for fun. Within a year or so I was<br />
pretty conversational. I started teaching my wife, Kelly, Hindi as well, and we<br />
used it as a secret language when we were out in public.</p>

	<p>Based on my self-driven Indian cultural immersion, when an opportunity<br />
came up at the big company I worked for to have someone expatriate to India to help set up a<br />
software development center, I was the first choice. My wife and I<br />
spent a year and a half living in Bangalore  trying to<br />
blend in like real Indians (except for the physical appearance thing of<br />
course).</p>
	<p style="float:left"><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/veena.jpg" alt="Veena" /><br/>
Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/dalbera/">J.P. Dalbï¿½ra</a></p>
	<p>We took two private Hindi classes per week plus I took<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_language">Kannada</a> and studied the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veena">Veena</a><br />
twice a week each as well.  The Veena lessons were particularly cool<br />
because the teacher didn&#8217;t speak very much English at all and wrote<br />
all the music in Kannada script, which I had<br />
taught myself over a long weekend after we moved to Bangalore (I discovered that after learning to read<br />
Hindi, it was relatively easy to learn any Indian language&#8217;s writing system). Knowing that I couldn&#8217;t have succeeded in these Veena lessons had I been limited to English was extremely empowering.</p>
	<p>While in India, we were fearless. We walked the back streets of Bangalore where westerners don&#8217;t go. We weren&#8217;t afraid to find our own transportation or do our own business anywhere, despite the huge cultural differences and language barriers. And when we went up North where everyone spoke Hindi, we didn&#8217;t have to worry about trying to find cab drivers who spoke English. We were able to go to small villages and talk to anyone we encountered. We got to see what India was really like and to experience the immense warmth of its people, which we&#8217;ve discovered is multiplied when you even try to say &#8220;Hello&#8221; or &#8220;Thank you&#8221; in their language.</p>
	<p style="float:right"><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/old/ChadAndKids.jpg" width="300" alt="Me and some children around Agra" /></p>
	<p>The benefit of learning Hindi didn&#8217;t stop at the Indian border. All of this led to another of the best experiences of my life.  When<br />
we were about to head home from India, my wife got an email from a<br />
non-profit group in Louisville, Kentucky (our home/destination) that<br />
supported Tibetan monastic refugees: &#8220;Help! Does anyone speak Tibetan<br />
or Hindi?&#8221;. The director of the non-profit<br />
(<a href="http://www.drepunggomang.com/">http://www.drepunggomang.com</a>) was desperate and half-joking when she<br />
sent the request. They had just moved a senior monk from an monastery<br />
in India to Kentucky to lead a dharma center when the local<br />
Tibetan translator had immigration problems and was suddenly no longer allowed to stay <br />
in the US. The monk didn&#8217;t speak <em>any</em> English, so the dharma center was basically<br />
stuck there with him without anyone who could help communicate. We didn&#8217;t know a whole lot about Tibetan Buddhists at the time but decided it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to help, so we responded saying we spoke Hindi and were due back in Kentucky in a week.</p>
	<p style="float:left"><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/geshesangye.jpg" width="200" alt="Geshe Sangay Gyatso" /></p>
	<p>This started a long relationship with the institute which included a<br />
stint with both of us serving as directors. We also became very close friends<br />
with <a href="http://www.drepunggomang.com/the_monks_of_dgi">Geshe Sangay Gyatso</a> from whom we learned a<br />
<em>lot</em> about Tibetan culture and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana">Mahayana Buddhism</a>. He even lived with us<br />
for a while. The center was in between lodging arrangments for him, so it made perfect sense for him to stay<br />
with us since we could all communicate. We had developed a family-like relationship. He stayed with us for about a month. I remember the smell of incense and the sound of chanting coming out of his room every morning as he<br />
 practiced his faith. It was a seriously humbling and life-changing experience to let<br />
the pressures of corporate life reflect from his perspective after<br />
work each day.</p>
	<p>Being Geshe Sangay&#8217;s translator led us to amazing<br />
experiences, including a lot of dialog with the spiritual leaders of<br />
Louisville when we attended and participated in interfaith events. One of the highlights of these experiences was when I <br />
had the opportunity to tour the gardens of <a href="http://www.monks.org/">The Abbey of Gethsemani</a> while translating<br />
for the recently retired abbot of the <a href="http://www.gomang.org/">Drepung Gomang Monastery</a> in India. I believe I&#8217;m one<br />
of very few non-monks to see the full beauty of the Abbey, and it&#8217;s an experience I&#8217;ll never forget.</p>
	<p>As the direct result of learning Hindi (and now a little Tibetan and Kannada), I&#8217;ve had some of the greatest career, cultural, social, and spiritual experiences of my life. I&#8217;ve made dear friends I could never have met or communicated with, and I&#8217;ve learned things that would have been much harder to learn without the language skills. Is learning a language a good use of your time? Absolutely.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Yesterday I <a href="http://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/2516989904">asked on Twitter</a> whether anyone was successfully using <a href="http://github.com/semanticart/is_paranoid/tree/master">is_paranoid</a> in a Rails application, because I had confused myself into thinking it couldn&#8217;t possibly work.</p>
<p>The problem I was having wasn&#8217;t is_paranoid&#8217;s fault, but it turns out it actually can&#8217;t do what I wanted it to do in its native state. The explanation of why is something I thought a number of Rubyists might benefit from hearing, so here it is.</p>
<p>Briefly, an explanation of is_paranoid: if you declare an ActiveRecord model to be paranoid, whenever you attempt to delete that model, is_paranoid will instead set a flag which indicates that the record is deleted. is_paranoid uses default_scope to filter out soft-deleted records in your queries. So you can act as if records are deleted without actually removing the rows. If is_paranoid is new to you but sounds familiar, you might be thinking of <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid/tree/master">acts_as_paranoid</a>, which is Rick Olson&#8217;s original implementation of this idea.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do for the specific application I&#8217;m working on is to declare that <em>every</em> model should inherit the is_paranoid behavior.  Easy enough, I thought, given the way these things typically work in Rails&#8217; inheritable accessor setup:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/142479.js"></script><p>But when I tried to destroy an instance of (for example) Person, the regular ActiveRecord destroy code was invoked and the records were being actually destroyed.  Bummer.</p>
<p>So I cracked open the code to is_paranoid and found this perfectly reasonable idiom:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/142478.js"></script><p>At this point, after pretending I was an idiot for a few minutes, I realized that this code was indeed <em>incapable</em> of doing what I wanted it to do.</p>
<p>Some of you already know why. For the rest of you, let&#8217;s talk about how Ruby&#8217;s mixins fit into its inheritance mechanism.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but when I think of something getting &#8220;mixed in&#8221; to something else, I imagine the two things becoming intertwined. So, the natural assumption when mixing a module into a Ruby class would be that the methods of the module get intertwined with the Ruby class. And for the HelloWorld of mixins, that indeed <em>appears</em> to be the case:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/142481.js"></script><p>But if you start mixing modules that implement methods the class also implements in, things don&#8217;t go quite as smoothly:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/142484.js"></script><p>Instead of &#8220;Overridden do_something&#8221; as some might expect, this code prints &#8220;Doing something in Thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because when we mix a module into a Ruby class, we&#8217;re not actually intermingling the methods of the module and the class.  Instead we&#8217;re inserting the module into the class&#8217;s inheritance hierarchy. A good way to see how this works is by using the &#8220;ancestors&#8221; method:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/142869.js"></script><p>When a method is called on an instance of SubThing, you can see that it is looked up first in SubThing&#8217;s class, then Thing&#8217;s class, <em>then</em> in IneffectiveOverride, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/yuml.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>(I used <a href="http://yuml.me">yuml</a> to generate this.  Cool site!)</p>
<p>To further demonstrate that mixins don&#8217;t really get &#8220;mixed in&#8221;, notice what happens when you try to include a module at multiple points in the inheritance hierarchy:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/142872.js"></script><p>If a module is already present at a higher point in the hierarchy, it won&#8217;t be mixed in again.</p>
<p>So is_paranoid was apparently built without the goal of being able to mix it into ActiveRecord::Base. Sounds reasonable to me.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I just finished reading the inspiring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246487770&amp;sr=8-1">The E-Myth Revisited</a>, which like my own first book <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/my-job-went-to-india">My Job Went to India</a> suffers from an incredibly bad name.</p>
<p>This is definitely one of the most practically useful and potentially career-changing business books I&#8217;ve read. As I started getting toward the end, I realized that I should have been taking notes. The book is an excellent read, but at its core, it can be distilled into a clear outline of stuff to <em>do</em> after you read it.  I was reading on my Kindle, which I&#8217;m still not good at using as a quick reference device. So, while I was excited about going back through the book and making myself a <span class="caps">TODO</span> list, I wasn&#8217;t sure how to best do it.</p>
<p>Then I remembered Derek Sivers&#8217; <a href="http://sivers.org/book">book list</a>. Derek has obviously spent a <em>lot</em> of time thoughtfully preparing a list of recommended books with reasons behind each recommendation. Not only that, he includes <a href="http://sivers.org/book/EMythRevisited">detailed notes</a> on each book.  I read his notes on E-Myth Revisited and was pleased to see that all of the important stuff is captured. Thanks Derek!</p>
<p>Speaking of Derek and books, don&#8217;t miss his book, <a href="http://sivers.org/pdf">How to Call Attention to Your Music</a>. It might be titled for musicians but I think everyone will find something valuable inside.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>As a young self-taught software developer, one of the first books I remember reading was Steve McConnell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/sg.htm">Software Project Survival Guide: How to Be Sure Your First Important Project Isn&#8217;t Your Last</a>. Who knows why I picked that one of all the possible books but I somehow knew I wanted to learn something about the broad practice of software development instead of just focusing on how to make specific widgets appear on the screen in Delphi or VB or how to automate the shell on our <span class="caps">VAX</span> cluster. I probably happened upon the book while aimlessly thumbing through spines in the local book store and was drawn to the snazzy cover.</p>
<p>And so it was that one of my first experiences in learning software became project-focused. &#8220;How to be sure your first important project isn&#8217;t your last&#8221; indeed. This thing called software development was apparently all about doing <em>projects</em>.</p>
<p>I was not alone in this understanding of how software development worked. Most of the people I encountered in my professional life approached software work this way. When something needs to get done, the first step is to name it&#8212;sometimes with a silly code name and sometimes with a generic name like &#8220;the HR system project&#8221; and the next step is to start planning the project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to notice a bad habit. Whenever I need to do something I don&#8217;t want to do. Or, worse, something that I want to do but I am prone to procrastinate (according to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437">The War of Art</a> procrastinating something is a sign that it&#8217;s important). The bad habit is this: I turn it into a project.</p>
<p>Projects are lovely for procrastinators. As soon as you call something a project, you give it permission to <em>not</em> be completed right now.</p>
<p>Events such as the <a href="http://railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble</a> have shown that it&#8217;s possible to finish software projects in two days that might take a corporate development team weeks or months in a normal project scenario. What&#8217;s the difference? Do the Rails Rumble participants throw quality out the window? Do their apps <em>suck</em>? Do they avoid testing and cut corners? Yea, sometimes. But so do most corporate development groups. That&#8217;s how things are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned over the course of my career that the amount of time I spend on something doesn&#8217;t positively correlate to its value or quality when finished. In other words, if I do something really quickly, it&#8217;s not likely to be less valuable than something that takes me a long time to do. Within obvious limits.</p>
<p>So if you want something to take a long time, call it a project. If you want it to get done, just get it done.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vagabonding-Uncommon-Guide-Long-Term-Travel/dp/0812992180/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244506800&amp;sr=8-1">Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</a> by Rolf Potts. I&#8217;m only a quarter of the way through it and it&#8217;s already worth the price. In the third chapter, Rolf talks about the American reaction to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> in the late 80s. The nation suddenly became, on the average, much more environmentally minded. So what did we do? We bought &#8220;environmental&#8221; products. Recycled products, energy-efficient this-or-that, health food, etc. What did we <em>not</em> do? Actually change our behavior.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from page 29:</p>
The more our life options get paraded around as consumer options, the more we forget that there&#8217;s a difference between the two.
<p>When I read this I recognized a pattern in myself and many people (everyone?) I know:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You want to lose weight, get excited and buy a bunch of books, magazines, DVDs, etc. on weight loss. Join a fitness site where you can log calories and workouts. Buy a book about a diet with an enticing name.</li>
	<li>Want to learn a new technology? Get a bunch of books, sign up for a mailing list.</li>
	<li>Train for a triathlon? Tons of triathlon books, a bicycle, funny triathlon clothes, triathlete magazine, etc.</li>
	<li>Want to learn a (human) language? Buy some software and books, music, movies.</li>
	<li>Want to learn an instrument? Books, an instrument, a case for the instrument, various accessories.</li>
	<li>Get more organized? Productivity books, a <span class="caps">PDA</span>, <span class="caps">PIM</span> software.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do this all the time. I decide I&#8217;m going to do something challenging, and my first step is to load up on <em>stuff</em> related to whatever it is I want to do. My second step is to continue to load up on stuff related to the topic. And so on.</p>
<p>Why do we do this? Because we know that we&#8217;re staring in the face of something that&#8217;s both very important and very scary. We want to feel like we&#8217;re doing something about whatever goal it is we have in mind. And the easiest way to feel like we&#8217;re doing something is to buy stuff.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s upsetting is to realize that in my case, simply buying the stuff is all I typically need to get enough of the feeling that I&#8217;m &#8220;dong something&#8221; to be satisfied.  The end result? I&#8217;m fat, I still can&#8217;t program in Haskell worth a damn, I haven&#8217;t run the triathlon, I don&#8217;t know Spanish, I can&#8217;t play accordion very well, and I&#8217;m totally unorganized.</p>
<p>Experiment: next time a really important goal comes along, I&#8217;m not allowed to do  <em>any</em> discretionary spending related to that goal.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that unfunded life goals stand a better chance of being met.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>While I was working on <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> I had the following Kurt Vonnegut quote (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-Without-Country-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/158322713X">A Man Without A Country</a>) at the top of the introduction. Right before we published it, my editor reminded me that we had to get permission to print it. I was unable to reach anyone from Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s estate on time, so I commented the quote out in the book&#8217;s source.</p>
<p>This is how The Passionate Programmer was supposed to begin:</p>
&#8220;I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, &#8216;If this isn&#8217;t nice, I don&#8217;t know what is.&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Next month, I&#8217;ll be presenting at <a href="http://rubynation.org">Ruby Nation</a> in my home away from home, Northern Virginia (I seem to spend almost as much time there as I do in Colorado).  The presentation will be something like this:</p>
<h2>The Passionate Programmer</h2>
<p>What should the career path of a programmer be? How do you know what you&#8217;re aiming for? What defines success?</p>
<p>Many of us started out assuming the answers to these questions included slowly climbing a corporate promotion structure,<br />
ultimately becoming a people or project manager and no longer a programmer.</p>
<p>But we didn&#8217;t get into software development so we could fill out spreadsheets and attend status meetings. We got into software<br />
development because we were excited about it. We wanted to be creative and to build great things.</p>
<p>From the author of The Passionate Programmer, this session will walk through how a software developer can not only succeed but<br />
work toward building a remarkable career. We&#8217;ll draw examples from business, the arts, music, and sports. By the end of the<br />
presentation, we will have laid out a structured framework for radically succeeding in the software industry.</p></div>
