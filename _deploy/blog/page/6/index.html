  <div class="article-content"><p>I was in a customer conference call with <a href="http://boboroshi.com/">John Athayde</a> recently, and he did something really smart. He was talking about his in-progress design for the customer&#8217;s product and he wanted to explain that we would have reusable snippets of the design which would allow us to consistently provide the same view of an important part of the system whenever it would show up. This being a Rails project, we would do this using ERb partials.</p>
<p>So, John said, &#8220;We will extract this out into little snippets that I&#8217;ll call&#8230;partials&#8221;.  And so on.</p>
<p>He could have made up a metaphor and used a new customer-friendly term for this.  Or he could have explained that we&#8217;re using Rails, and Rails supports this thing called &#8220;partials&#8221; which is&#8230;blah blah blah. But the former requires us to learn a dumb new word just for this project, and the latter is too much information. The term &#8220;partial&#8221; is a pretty good one to describe what it does. In fact, in most well-designed systems, the terms the <em>system</em> uses to describe concepts are pretty good.  Pretty easy to understand.</p>
<p>For some reason we developers feel compelled to hide these terms and concepts from our customers as if they&#8217;re children that can&#8217;t be trusted with sharp tools. They&#8217;re not idiots. They just know different things than we do. Imagine if they tried to hide <em>their</em> terms and concepts from you because they assumed you were unable to understand them.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> speak at an XP users&#8217; meeting several years ago, and when he got to the practice called &#8220;system metaphor&#8221;, he said he didn&#8217;t really do that practice so much anymore because (paraphrased from iffy memory), &#8220;Sometimes the best metaphor for a system is the system itself&#8221;. Note to self: keep that in mind more often.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>This is nothing revolutionary, but the number 20 has held special significance for me since I was a young teenager.  I learned that if I started something and was still doing it 20 days later, it <em>stuck</em>.</p>
<p>Since good habits seemed to stick after 20 days, I started to set 20 days as a goal whenever I wanted to get into the habit of doing a good, responsible thing.  Turns out, it works.</p>
<p>I think there are two reasons it works. The obvious is that, for me, 20 days is the right amount of time to internalize behavior or get used to a new feeling, thing, taste, activity or what-not.  The less obvious but more important reason is that 20 days is short. It&#8217;s easy to commit to doing something for 20 days. It&#8217;s hard to commit to doing something forever. So, because I have this short duration which I believe to be like a magic spell, I&#8217;m able to convince myself to actually <em>try</em> to do something hard.  Even if something sucks, I can do it for 20 days.</p>
<p>The number 20 probably won&#8217;t work for everyone, but I highly recommend trying it out and fine tuning the duration. Want to eat better?  Exercise? Learn Japanese? Practice a musical instrument more responsibly? Try to do it <em>well</em> for 20 days. That&#8217;s it. Don&#8217;t worry about whether it&#8217;s going to stick. Just promise yourself the 20 days.</p>
<p>Even if the magic spell doesn&#8217;t work for you, the worst case is that you do something good for you for 20 days.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Kelly and I went to <a href="http://www.afterthoughtbar.com/">The Afterthought</a> in Little Rock last night for the Monday night jazz show.  They&#8217;ve been running Monday night jazz at The Afterthought for 14 years now.  Before that it was at a place called The Oyster Bar (that was when I lived in Little Rock and briefly played jazz music here).</p>
<p>The same people were there that were there last time.  They had more gray in their hair, but it was a familiar scene.</p>
<p>The striking familiarity wasn&#8217;t the people, though.  It was the structure of the event.  I never noticed it before (maybe a case of not seeing the forest for the trees), but jazz gigs typically follow a common structure and share a set of common traits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It was scheduled to start at 8. Nobody was there at 8.  It started at 8:30.</li>
	<li>The band had obviously rehearsed 0 times for the gig. They didn&#8217;t know what songs they were going to play until right before each song started. Improvisation to the max.</li>
	<li>Without rehearsal or a set list, they picked songs that everyone knew. This means they picked the same songs we&#8217;ve all played a million times.</li>
	<li>They started with a bossa nova. They followed that with a waltz. Then (as I felt the same internal strife they apparently did) I heard the band leader say to the drummer, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what we should play next, but it should be a swing tune. We&#8217;ve already done a bossa and a waltz.&#8221;  Jazz people have an unwritten rule that you have to play a blues, something with a beat, a waltz, a ballad, and a swing tune in a set. It&#8217;s as if the set is not properly balanced otherwise and the jazz police will arrest them for producing an unbalanced set.</li>
	<li>They had someone sit in and played a song nobody else knew, so they all got the fakebooks out and read along.</li>
	<li>In every song, every band member played a solo in the same order.  In every song at the end of the solos, the saxophone played &#8220;traded fours&#8221; with the drummer.  Trading fours is when an instrumentalist improvises for four measures and then the band drops out for the drummer to improvise for four measures, until they get once or twice through the form of the tune. I can count the number of instances of trading fours I&#8217;ve enjoyed as a listener on the fingers of one hand.</li>
	<li>After the &#8220;last song&#8221; before the break, they played the standard set break tune, which is a song originally done by Miles Davis that sounds like the closing tag of a circus show. I can&#8217;t remember the name of it, and they probably can&#8217;t either. It&#8217;s meant to be transitional music over which the band says &#8220;thank you and we&#8217;ll be right back&#8221; but it usually lasts 5 minutes or more. It lasted 5 minutes or more.</li>
	<li>The entire band ran immediately outside to smoke.</li>
	<li>We left, but they probably took a break that lasted nearly as long as they had played.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a whole lot of ritual. And the funny thing is that I bet none of the band members enjoy most of it and I know the audience doesn&#8217;t care about any of it. The whole routine is constrained by a set of rules that aren&#8217;t done in the name of either the customer (audience) or the supplier (musician). They&#8217;re done for no one.</p>
<p>I have done all of these things countless times and I have not ever enjoyed the constraints. It&#8217;s only now that I&#8217;ve been away from it that I realize the constraints even exist.</p>
<p>I wonder what sort of things I do now that hindsight will reveal to be pointless ritual.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently been revisiting my musical roots.  I recently visited the home of my dormant music career (Memphis, TN) and spent time former band-mates and collaborators.  I&#8217;ve been also been dipping back into the jazz and classical composition worlds, learning who&#8217;s new on the scene and rediscovering old favorites.</p>
<p>Something has stood out as I&#8217;ve been browsing through online material connecting the dots again.  It&#8217;s a part of the culture I took for granted as a musician but which now feels sort of foreign. Musicians often talk about each other (and even themselves) in terms of their influences.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003182/Eric-Dolphy.html">example</a>:</p>
Among Dolphy&#8217;s early influences were Charlie Parker and the sounds of nature.
<p>It&#8217;s also common to talk about who <em>taught</em> you as a musician.  Here&#8217;s a snippet from my <a href="http://www.parkerandersonjazz.com/parker/">college roommate/bandmate&#8217;s bio</a>:</p>
<pre>
Chris Parker was born in North Little Rock, Arkansas. He first learned from local Arkansas musicians, most notably:   
Charles Thomas, Art Porter, Sr., Bob Steele, Lee Tomboulian, and Michael Bates. Chris moved to Memphis, TN in 1991. 
There he received his BA degree from the University of Memphis and learned from/ studied with musicians including Gene
 Rush, James Williams, Herman Green, Fred Ford, Calvin Newborn, Bill Mobley, Alvin Fielder, Kidd Jordan, Joe Jennings, and 
Vernel Fournier.
</pre>
<p>This creates a strong emphasis on creating a <em>tradition</em> which is carried forward and evolve generationally.  Jazz is a fairly new genre but here&#8217;s an example &#8220;family tree&#8221; of jazz: Lester Young <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician_timeline.php?id=11573">was influenced early on by Frankie Trambauer</a>.  Dexter Gordon was heavily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Gordon">influenced by Lester Young</a>.  Dexter Gordon was in turn the biggest influence on a young <a href="http://www.jazzreview.com/articledetails.cfm?ID=2166">Virginia Mayhew</a>.</p>
<p>So we have Frankie &#8594; Lester &#8594; Dexter &#8594; Virginia &#8594; ???</p>
<p>This visible passing on of tradition not only conveys a pride in the craft, but it gives listeners an understanding of what to expect when approaching a new artist. Not a completely road map but at least some clues.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/my-job-went-to-india">My Job Went to India</a> I wrote about standing on the shoulders of giants in our industry. Musicians make explicit which giants they&#8217;re standing on the shoulders of. It strikes me as a bit of a shame that we don&#8217;t do that as programmers.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Being an organizers of Ruby conferences myself, I always enjoy going to the regional conferences.  I&#8217;ve been to the <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">Mountain West RubyConf</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyhoedown.com/">Ruby Hoedown</a> and <a href="http://site.locaweb.com.br/railssummit/default.asp?language=7">Rails Summit Latin America</a>.  Each was excellent in its own unique way. It&#8217;s also a great pleasure for me to attend a conference I&#8217;m not organizing.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m looking forward to the upcoming <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/">Scotland on Rails</a> in March.  <a href="http://marcelmolina.com">Marcel</a> and I will be presenting a tutorial for charity at this year&#8217;s conference.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard great things about last year&#8217;s Scotland on Rails, and I trust my friends in Scotland to put on an excellent show.  If you haven&#8217;t been to Edinburgh, you owe yourself a trip.  It&#8217;s an incredibly beautiful city.</p>
<p>What better way to explore new lands than to do it by invitation as a speaker?  Scotland on Rails has opened its <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/proposals.html">Call for Proposals</a> (it&#8217;s been open for a while, but I&#8217;m slow).  The <span class="caps">CFP</span> closes in 2 weeks (December 1st), so if you&#8217;re interested in speaking don&#8217;t be late.  From what <a href="http://www.cardboardsoftware.com/">Alan</a> tells me, they are especially interested in hearing how to do <span class="caps">BIG</span> projects with Ruby and Rails.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> is only a little over 2 weeks away. Time flies!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">series of interviews with speakers</a> leading up to the conference.</p>
<p>This time is <a href="http://blog.bleything.net/">Ben Bleything</a>.  Ben is going to be speaking at RubyConf about <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/83">Ruby and Music</a></p>
<h2>What are you currently doing with Ruby and music?</h2>
<p>This is going to be a recurring theme, so I&#8217;ll get it out of the way<br />
here.  I think of myself more as a toolsmith than an actual creator.<br />
I&#8217;m not doing anything with Ruby and music per se&#8230; I&#8217;m trying to<br />
create tools for other people to use.</p>
<p>My creativity manifests in such a way that I&#8217;m actually pretty bad at<br />
creating &#8220;art&#8221;.  I&#8217;m a semi-failed musician, and I don&#8217;t have any<br />
illusions about programming being the path to making sweet, sweet music.<br />
I just think it&#8217;s an interesting problem to solve.</p>
<p>I have this vision of showing up at RubyConf in 2010 and having people<br />
using the stuff that Giles and Yossef and myself and others create to<br />
make some rad music.</p>
<h2>You spoke about Ruby and electronics last year.  How did you get into electronics?  What got you excited about it?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been into electronics since I was 12 or 13.  I was the kid who<br />
always took stuff apart.  I started frequenting my neighborhood Radio<br />
Shack around 14, building little lighty-uppy things and noisemakers and<br />
the like.  I grew bored of that pretty quickly, but I got back into it<br />
after college around the time that the Arduino came out.</p>
<p>One of the things that draws me to programming in general is the feeling<br />
of empowerment.  It&#8217;s really cool to be able to make a computer do<br />
your nefarious bidding.  Now apply that feeling to a physical device<br />
and you&#8217;re talking about a whole different level of that empowerment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said before that I feel like I was born 40 years too late&#8230; that I<br />
should have been hacking in the &#8216;60s.  Programming for microcontrollers<br />
is, in a lot of ways, as close as I can get to that.  Starting with bare<br />
metal and building an application, even if it&#8217;s as simple as blinking a<br />
light (the hello world of electronics) is deeply satisfying.</p>
<h2>Being into electronics, have you ever tried to build your own electronic instrument or have the computer play a real instrument with motors?</h2>
<p>Not yet, no.  Both are interesting ideas but getting close to requiring<br />
actual musical knowledge, and that&#8217;s where I start to get scared :)</p>
<p>I am playing around with hooking up video game instruments (think Rock<br />
Band and Guitar Hero) to a computer.  This sounds pretty mundane, and I<br />
guess that it is&#8230; but the trick is that I&#8217;ll be passing those through<br />
Ruby in order to provide the instruments with a bit more intelligence.</p>
<p>I guess the bottom line is that I&#8217;m much more interested in building<br />
systems (hardware or software) that more experienced musicians can use<br />
as tools&#8230; which brings us back to the toolsmith point above.</p>
<h2>Can computers generate beautiful music?  Dance beats seem easy. What about jazz improvisations?  Classical music?  Pop songs?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that a computer <strong>can</strong> generate beautiful music, but I think it<br />
would be mostly coincidental.  I&#8217;m still undecided on whether you can<br />
program a computer to <strong>always</strong> generate beautiful music.  It surely<br />
happens by chance sometimes, though.</p>
<p>I suspect that there&#8217;s interesting results waiting down the path of<br />
doing things like markov chaining with music instead of text.  Analyzing<br />
and chaining music is a significantly more complex problem than doing it<br />
with words, but my gut says with the right corpus, you could get some<br />
pretty interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, though, I think music has to have soul to be truly great.<br />
I want everyone to try to prove me wrong, though!</p>
<h2>Ruby, electronics, and music is a lot of ground to cover.  Are you passionate and excited about anything else in particular outside of these?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m passionate and excited about everything that catches my interest,<br />
honestly.  I&#8217;ve just chosen not to focus any energy on anything else<br />
right now.  I want to find ways to share my experience with others&#8230; to<br />
get people excited about doing the things they thought were too hard.</p>
<p>My electronics presentation last year is a prime example of that.  This<br />
stuff isn&#8217;t difficult, it&#8217;s just intimidating.  If I can lower the<br />
barrier to entry, either by educating or providing tools, then I feel<br />
like I&#8217;ve done my job.  I&#8217;m really hoping that my talk this year will do<br />
the same for the people interested in music.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> is coming soon!  We&#8217;re sold out but you can still get on the waiting list.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">series of interviews with speakers</a> leading up to the conference.</p>
<p>This time is <a href="http://vanderburg.org/">Glenn Vanderburg</a>.  Glenn is a long time Rubyist and dynamic languages fan. He&#8217;s also Chief Scientist  at <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/">Relevance</a>.</p>
<h2>There was a time when Java was cool and new like Ruby is now. I remember drawing criticism for thinking it was &#8220;ready for the Enterprise&#8221;.  You wrote one of the first books about Java. How does the current state of affairs with Ruby and dynamic language adoption differ from what was happening with Java back then?</h2>
<p>The objections to Ruby seem a bit more mature than the objections to Java were.  I remember a lot of misunderstanding about Java being &#8220;interpreted&#8221;, and about GC being &#8220;inherently slow&#8221;.  I also remember people who were outraged that they couldn&#8217;t turn the safety features off, like array bounds checking.  Those are all rather ridiculous arguments, but many people clung to them for years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased that almost nobody objects to Ruby being open-source.  It&#8217;s also great that so many people understand that &#8220;fast enough&#8221; is fast enough, and that you get a lot more benefit from architectural choices than you do from raw language speed.  Finally, the Ruby language itself is more mature and stable than Java was then, and that helps a lot.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there&#8217;s one big problem Ruby has now that Java had in 1997: the language implementation is too simplistic, and there&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<h2>What would you say are the top 2 or 3 features the Ruby world could steal from existing VMs?</h2>
<p>Two of them are already widely understood:  bytecode interpretation (which all the new VM projects use) and top-notch garbage collection.  But the really big win will come from dynamic optimization based on type feedback, including heavy use of method inlining.  JRuby is already getting some of that benefit from the <span class="caps">JVM</span>, and I suspect GemStone is using the same techniques to make MagLev fast.</p>
<p>Saying &#8220;Ruby is slow, but it&#8217;s fast enough&#8221; is true for a lot of the things we&#8217;re doing today, but it&#8217;s also a bit of a cop out.  There are definitely tasks for which we&#8217;d love to use Ruby, but it isn&#8217;t fast enough.  The primary motivation for my talk is to spread knowledge about type feedback into the Ruby community.  It&#8217;s always been a little hard to get information about how the <span class="caps">JVM</span> and Strongtalk work, and they have a reputation for being extremely complicated black magic.  Many of the details are quite complex, but the basic principles are actually rather simple.  My hope is that a few people with good C and assembly language skills will have their eyes opened to the possibilities and start making contributions to the Ruby VM projects.</p>
<h2>What do you think about Google&#8217;s new V8 VM?  Do you think there&#8217;s much to learn from it? Will we see a serious Ruby implementation on it?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s fascinating technology, but (from what I&#8217;ve seen so far) not quite as nice a fit for Ruby as I was hoping for.  The v8 team kept a tight focus on exactly what JavaScript needed.  The result is that it will be harder to implement Ruby on it than I hoped, and the benefits will be less than I was expecting.  It&#8217;s a great JavaScript VM, though.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s actually more interesting to me is that 2008 seems to be the year of JavaScript VMs.  SquirrelFish, TraceMonkey, and v8 are all making big advances in JavaScript performance, using different techniques.  And they seem to have begun a competition similar to the WebKit/Opera Acid3 race from earlier this year.  That kind of thing might seem like a sideshow, but it highlights core technical issues that are usually hidden from view, and that kind of competition ends up raising standards across the board.  JavaScript will certainly benefit from this competition, but it won&#8217;t stop there.  In the process, previously obscure technical details (not least of which is the fact that a language can be as dynamic as JavaScript and still be fast) will become widely known, and new tricks may be discovered.  Ruby and other dynamic languages will certainly benefit from that.</p>
<h2>Do you think any of the in-progress Ruby implementations is poised to be the big one that takes over the Ruby world? Why or why not?</h2>
<p>First of all, I don&#8217;t think we have to have a &#8220;big one that takes over.&#8221;  Having multiple VMs with different tradeoffs seems to me to be a tremendous advantage for our community, as long as they all pass the same, thorough spec suite.  JRuby fills a very important niche and does it really well.  There&#8217;s some fantastic work in <span class="caps">YARV</span>.  I fully expect IronRuby to be a big success among people with an investment in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> platform.  And all the signs are that MagLev will be an awesome option for those who need either commercial support, lots of raw speed, and/or a terrific, scalable persistence system.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m watching Rubinius with great interest.  I was initially skeptical of the project; it seemed so risky to try to build everything from scratch, from the bottom all the way up through the core libraries.  All of the state-of-the-art dynamic language VMs in existence were done by heavily funded large teams of experts.  I&#8217;m more optimistic today.  For one thing, Rubinius has more funding than I realized.  Also, I see now that Evan Phoenix has two advantages those earlier teams didn&#8217;t have: <span class="caps">TDD</span> (which he&#8217;s using even on the C++ part of Rubinius) and <span class="caps">LLVM</span>, which already has code generation and optimization support for many different machine architectures.</p>
<p>Evan likes to say that because most of Rubinius is written in Ruby, making Rubinius acceptably fast will have to be done in the low-level VM mechanisms, which will benefit all Ruby code, not just the core libraries.  That&#8217;s exactly what drove the advances we see today in the Self, Java, and various Smalltalk VMs &#8212; the core libraries (and in some cases most of the languages themselves) were written in the target language, so the VM became the only avenue for really speeding things up.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a third advantage Rubinius <strong>could</strong> have, but doesn&#8217;t, at least not yet.  Most of the Rubinius contributors are working in the Ruby parts of the system, which is probably where the priority needs to be right now.  But soon, the focus will need to shift to the C++ VM.  I&#8217;m hopeful that others will chip in at that level before too long, and if my talk gets some people started on that, I&#8217;ll be thrilled.</p>
<h2>What are you passionate about outside of computer programming?</h2>
<p>The most truthful answer is rather common, and most people won&#8217;t find it too interesting: my family and my faith.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m constantly reading and enjoying music &#8212; in both cases, from many genres.  I read a broad mix of science, history, theology, and literature.  My favorite author is John McPhee, because he explores topics that seem dull and mundane on the surface, and reveals the fascination within.  That&#8217;s a great match for me, because I&#8217;ve learned that <strong>anything</strong> is interesting once you begin to understand it.</p></div>

<time datetime="2008-09-23T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">2008.09.23</time>

  <div class="article-content"><p>In preparation for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>, I&#8217;m doing a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">series of interviews</a> of some of the speakers.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s interview is with <a href="http://terralien.com">Nathaniel Talbott</a>, creator of Ruby&#8217;s built-in Test::Unit framework and long time Rubyist.  At RubyConf, Nathaniel will be presenting <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/24">Fear of Programming</a>.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;ve spoken at 7 out of 7 RubyConfs and you&#8217;re about to speak at your 8th. I&#8217;ve noticed your topics are veering farther and farther away from programming in Ruby. Is this because you&#8217;re afraid?</h2>
<p>The primary impetus behind my talk this year is my discovery of two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I get lethargic/depressed/unproductive/unhappy when I&#8217;m not spending<br />
a significant portion of my time creating.</li>
	<li>I often don&#8217;t create because I&#8217;m afraid to start.</li>
</ul>
<p>These realizations grew out of my being the &#8220;business guy&#8221; for<br />
<a href="http://terralien.com/">Terralien</a> for going on three years now, and thus not billing myself<br />
out for development work. While doing sales, marketing, project<br />
management, etc., is creating in some sense, I&#8217;m still a developer at<br />
heart and to create I need to <strong>code</strong>. When I don&#8217;t, everything in my<br />
life (including all the business stuff) suffers. And the primary<br />
hurdle to writing code has been fear.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes and no. Yes, a large part of the<br />
reason I&#8217;ve trended away from talking about code has been because fear<br />
kept me from writing code to talk about. No for this year, because<br />
I&#8217;ve written more Ruby in the past year than I have in a while, and<br />
have more to talk about, but I think talking about the fear is more<br />
important this year.</p>
<p>And if one made the assumption there won&#8217;t be any code in my talk,<br />
they might be in for a surprise&#8230;</p>
<h2>At the first Ruby conference, you spoke about Lapidary, which became Test::Unit.  Are you as zealous about testing as you were when you created Lapidary? Why or why not?</h2>
<p>This is actually a big part of my talk, so I don&#8217;t want to give away<br />
too much. Suffice it to say that my perspective on testing has changed<br />
significantly over the past six years, and a lot of that change has to<br />
do with fighting fear.</p>
<h2>How does it feel having your first Ruby project in ruby&#8217;s standard library? As one of the creators of RubyGems, I&#8217;m no stranger to harsh criticism of my Open Source code. Have you encountered a lot of this?  Is it worth it?</h2>
<p>To answer the last question first, it is <strong>very</strong> worth it. I don&#8217;t<br />
think test/unit has drawn the ire that RubyGems has, since a testing<br />
framework doesn&#8217;t have quite the entrenchment that a packaging system<br />
does. This has allowed various competitors and add-ons to spring up,<br />
giving would-be critics an outlet for their &#8220;I could do it better&#8221;<br />
ideas, and the cool thing is that they often <strong>can</strong> do it better and we<br />
all benefit.</p>
<p>As far as getting test/unit in to the standard library, it was great<br />
for me but mostly bad for test/unit. It&#8217;s a big plus to tell potential<br />
clients that you wrote something in the Ruby stdlib, and it does great<br />
things for your Google juice. At the same time, I was already<br />
struggling with motivation and productivity when working on test/unit<br />
at the time, and what I discovered is that getting a library in the<br />
stdlib is a huge demotivator for working on it, at least for me. It<br />
becomes <strong>much</strong> easier to stick with the status quo than to change it.</p>
<p>So if getting &#8220;standardized&#8221; was good for me and bad for test/unit,<br />
how was it for the Ruby community? I think in general it was a good<br />
thing. We needed a testing library in the stdlib, and test/unit might<br />
not be brilliant but it is solid and fairly simple. Having it there<br />
really helped the testing culture in Ruby, and that continues through<br />
today. I like to think that Ruby shipping with testing built-in<br />
influenced David to ship Rails with testing built-in, and I think<br />
that&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<h2>How can I be more productive? I would love to be one of these people who churns out useful libraries once every few weeks and keeps them maintained.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll have lots to say about this in my talk, but for now I&#8217;ll give two<br />
conflicting points of advice: first, you have to <em>defocus</em>. There&#8217;s a<br />
real tendency to get tunnel vision about the things we &#8220;need&#8221; and to<br />
stop playing with the things we <strong>want</strong>. Stop worrying about useful and<br />
instead explore fun and interesting.</p>
<p>The second piece of advice is to <em>focus</em>. There are so many projects<br />
and activities that we can spend time on, we have to choose. Review<br />
your list of projects: are they all things you&#8217;re excited about<br />
working on and that you&#8217;re one of the best people to work on? I handed<br />
off maintainer-ship of test/unit for exactly this reason: it was<br />
distracting me from other things I was more passionate about.</p>
<p>Confused and intrigued? Great, now you&#8217;re motivated to come listen to<br />
<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/24">Fear of Programming</a> at <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>!</p>
<h2>What are you passionate about outside of computer programming?</h2>
<p>Well, I have four amazing kids (ages 5, 3, 2 and 1) who I love<br />
watching grow and learn. We&#8217;ll be homeschooling all of them when the<br />
times comes, so I have lots of years of learning with them to look<br />
forward to. I&#8217;m also really passionate about entrepreneurship, and<br />
have a few things cooking in that sphere, not the least of which is<br />
<a href="http://spreedly.com">http://spreedly.com</a>. I also enjoy studying the Bible, and enjoy<br />
teaching at our church every few months. So, life is pretty busy, but<br />
I&#8217;m loving every minute of it!</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>In preparation for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>, I&#8217;m doing a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">series of interviews</a> of some of the speakers.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s interview is with author, speaker, and software craftsman, <a href="http://8thlight.com">Micah Martin of 8th Light</a> and formerly of <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com">Object Mentor</a>.  At RubyConf, Micah will be presenting <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/32">Ruby Kata and Sparring</a>.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;re speaking about exercises to improve your coding skills.  From what I know about the ideas you will present, they are very tactical and performance-oriented in nature.  We don&#8217;t usually think of programming as a performance activity. Is it?</h2>
<p>Sure it is.  When a novelist writes a novel, or a poet writes a poem, aren&#8217;t they performing?  Their work, their words, have to entertain.  They have to communicate ideas, and inspire their audience of readers.  When we write code, we have two audiences; the computer and our peers.  The computer is not a very demanding audience.  But our fellow programmers, they can be very harsh critics.  The code we write, if it&#8217;s good, will easily communicate ideas to our peers.  It will inspire understanding of our intent.  And if it&#8217;s really good, it will entertain.</p>
<h2>Dave Thomas did a series of &#8220;code kata&#8221; many years ago. Is the kata portion of your talk a continuation of those same ideas?</h2>
<p>Yeah, for the most part.  Unclebob did some as well.  It&#8217;s a great idea that hasn&#8217;t seemed to gain much traction.  It&#8217;s lack of popularity is understandable.  A skeptic might describe code kata as &#8220;writing useless code by yourself in your free time&#8221;.  Sounds fun eh?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same in martial arts.  For the lower belt ranks, kata is rarely the activity of choice.  Most students would rather kick bags, break boards, and spar with other students.  Fortunately in martial arts, instructors influence students to practice kata over and over.  With time and experience, students learn to appreciate kata.  And once they catch the bug, you&#8217;ll find martial artists practicing kata outside of class whenever they get the chance.</p>
<p>Code kata requires discipline, but it offers a deep well of knowledge about our craft.  More than most groups, I feel that Ruby programmers understand the need for good coding form, and are more likely to embrace kata.</p>
<h2>Everyone who calls his- or herself a musician knows that practice is essential.  The same with sports and other disciplines. Why don&#8217;t many programmers practice?</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  Maybe it&#8217;s because many programmers are programmers because it&#8217;s a good career yet they don&#8217;t really enjoy programming.  It&#8217;s hard for me to imagine any musicians who don&#8217;t enjoy music or athletes who don&#8217;t enjoy their sport.</p>
<h2>Some call programming engineering.  Others call it art. Still others call it craft. You&#8217;re using a fighting metaphor. What&#8217;s your take on the subject?</h2>
<p>Having devoted 5 years of my life to martial arts and more than that to software, I can&#8217;t help but to compare and contrast the two.  What I&#8217;ve found is that they&#8217;re not so unalike.  They both have a scientific foundation yet require copious practice to become proficient.  This is my definition of a craft.</p>
<p>Sparring is one facet of martial arts that doesn&#8217;t seem to have a counterpart in software.  Sparring is great.  After all the devotion and practice you invest in your craft, you get to pit your skills against those of your peers and see who comes out on top.  It&#8217;s a tool to measure your progress and learn your weaknesses.  It&#8217;s also fun.  I hope to see more of this in software.</p>
<h2>What are you passionate about outside of computer programming?</h2>
<p>Besides my family and software, my passions tend to jump around.  Martial arts has been a significant passion of mine.  I really enjoy playing the guitar.  Recently I&#8217;ve been playing around with basic electronic components, building little robots.  Basketball and soccer keep me active.  And as soon as I can spare the time, I&#8217;ll learn to fly airplanes.</p></div>
