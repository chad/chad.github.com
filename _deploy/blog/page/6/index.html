  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is an excellent service for allowing people to vent. I&#8217;d guess a large percentage of the messages that pump through the site are complaints about something (technology, airlines, restaurants, etc.). I know I&#8217;ve posted my share of complaints.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="http://ozmm.org/">Chris Wanstrath</a> linked to <a href="http://twitter.com/defunkt/status/112575642">one of his Twitter complaints</a> from a year and a half ago:</p>
failed at setting up a public git repo with working push. giving up for tonight, working on something else.
<p>This was probably the first seed that led to the birth of the extremely popular <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to remember this every time I type in a whiny tweet about something I have the power to fix. Complaining and being critical is great as long as you&#8217;re willing to do something about the problem when you can. And, maybe if it&#8217;s annoying enough for you to type it into Twitter to share with your followers, it&#8217;s annoying enough that a solution could be your next big thing.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I used to think I would end up as a composer of <a href="http://everything2.com/e2node/20th%2520Century%2520Classical%2520Music">classical music</a>. I studied with one of my favorite composers, <a href="http://kamranince.com">Kamran Ince</a>.</p>
<p>The process of composing music is very similar to the process of writing software. In fact, my brain has trouble distinguishing between the two disciplines sometimes.  One thing that&#8217;s very similar between the two is that they are both abstract and in both cases you start with a blank page (though the &#8220;page&#8221; for software is typically in an editor on your computer screen).</p>
<p>More than once in my careers (music and software), this has led me to a dilemma: I get stuck because I&#8217;m overwhelmed by the limitless possibilities.</p>
<p>This happened to me once as a composer. I was experiencing a sort of writer&#8217;s block. So Kamran suggested something bizarre: write a short piece in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_form">Sonata Allegro form</a>.</p>
<p>While Sonata Allegro form is an often-used structure for compositions, there aren&#8217;t many living composers who use it. It&#8217;s old fashioned. So writing New Music in this form is a strange proposition.  Kamran framed it as a one-week exercise to stop the writer&#8217;s block, and I figured writing <em>something</em> would be better than writing nothing, so I went with it.</p>
<p>What flowed from there was a  25 minute piece for violin, cello, clarinet, and piano (the same instrumentation as Messiaen&#8217;s <a href="http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/performances/messiaen-qtet.html">Quartet for the End of Time</a>, which was also an inspiration for the piece) in five movements. As a young composer, this was pretty epic. It was by far the best and most inspired piece of music I had written to date. The whole thing wasn&#8217;t in Sonata Allegro, of course. Just one movement (actually just the beginning of the movement). But the constraint had seeded my creativity (how to make it interesting while working in an outdated framework) and had, best of all, removed any <em>fear</em> I had about starting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done similar things with software since then. It works just as well.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this today while chatting with Alan Francis, when he mentioned writing Java code with the rule that you can use <a href="http://cardboardsoftware.com/2007/5/27/redefining-simple.html">no braces</a> except where Java forces you to for class and method definitions.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that not only does this constraint help to solve the &#8220;too abstract&#8221; problem but it (arguably) leads to interesting (and maybe better) design choices.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>As I <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2008/12/4/develop-a-good-habit-in-20-days">said recently</a>, 20 days is the right length for me to develop beneficial habits.  It just so happens that, counting today, there are 20 days left in 2008.</p>
<p>So what should we do? I&#8217;m thinking about trying to write fiction every day for the rest of the year. Or practice the saxophone.  Or write short pieces of &#8220;classical&#8221; music.  I&#8217;m not sure yet, but I have the rest of the day to decide and put the plan into action.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://metaatem.net/">Erik Kastner</a>  showed me recently that Steve Pavlina posted something <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/">similar</a> a few years ago. At the bottom of the article he includes a bunch of ideas of things you could try to do for 30 days. So if you&#8217;re interested but don&#8217;t know what you want to do yet, have a look at his suggestions. They might trigger an inspiration.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Update: I chose fiction writing. Time will tell.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I was in a customer conference call with <a href="http://boboroshi.com/">John Athayde</a> recently, and he did something really smart. He was talking about his in-progress design for the customer&#8217;s product and he wanted to explain that we would have reusable snippets of the design which would allow us to consistently provide the same view of an important part of the system whenever it would show up. This being a Rails project, we would do this using ERb partials.</p>
<p>So, John said, &#8220;We will extract this out into little snippets that I&#8217;ll call&#8230;partials&#8221;.  And so on.</p>
<p>He could have made up a metaphor and used a new customer-friendly term for this.  Or he could have explained that we&#8217;re using Rails, and Rails supports this thing called &#8220;partials&#8221; which is&#8230;blah blah blah. But the former requires us to learn a dumb new word just for this project, and the latter is too much information. The term &#8220;partial&#8221; is a pretty good one to describe what it does. In fact, in most well-designed systems, the terms the <em>system</em> uses to describe concepts are pretty good.  Pretty easy to understand.</p>
<p>For some reason we developers feel compelled to hide these terms and concepts from our customers as if they&#8217;re children that can&#8217;t be trusted with sharp tools. They&#8217;re not idiots. They just know different things than we do. Imagine if they tried to hide <em>their</em> terms and concepts from you because they assumed you were unable to understand them.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> speak at an XP users&#8217; meeting several years ago, and when he got to the practice called &#8220;system metaphor&#8221;, he said he didn&#8217;t really do that practice so much anymore because (paraphrased from iffy memory), &#8220;Sometimes the best metaphor for a system is the system itself&#8221;. Note to self: keep that in mind more often.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>This is nothing revolutionary, but the number 20 has held special significance for me since I was a young teenager.  I learned that if I started something and was still doing it 20 days later, it <em>stuck</em>.</p>
<p>Since good habits seemed to stick after 20 days, I started to set 20 days as a goal whenever I wanted to get into the habit of doing a good, responsible thing.  Turns out, it works.</p>
<p>I think there are two reasons it works. The obvious is that, for me, 20 days is the right amount of time to internalize behavior or get used to a new feeling, thing, taste, activity or what-not.  The less obvious but more important reason is that 20 days is short. It&#8217;s easy to commit to doing something for 20 days. It&#8217;s hard to commit to doing something forever. So, because I have this short duration which I believe to be like a magic spell, I&#8217;m able to convince myself to actually <em>try</em> to do something hard.  Even if something sucks, I can do it for 20 days.</p>
<p>The number 20 probably won&#8217;t work for everyone, but I highly recommend trying it out and fine tuning the duration. Want to eat better?  Exercise? Learn Japanese? Practice a musical instrument more responsibly? Try to do it <em>well</em> for 20 days. That&#8217;s it. Don&#8217;t worry about whether it&#8217;s going to stick. Just promise yourself the 20 days.</p>
<p>Even if the magic spell doesn&#8217;t work for you, the worst case is that you do something good for you for 20 days.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Kelly and I went to <a href="http://www.afterthoughtbar.com/">The Afterthought</a> in Little Rock last night for the Monday night jazz show.  They&#8217;ve been running Monday night jazz at The Afterthought for 14 years now.  Before that it was at a place called The Oyster Bar (that was when I lived in Little Rock and briefly played jazz music here).</p>
<p>The same people were there that were there last time.  They had more gray in their hair, but it was a familiar scene.</p>
<p>The striking familiarity wasn&#8217;t the people, though.  It was the structure of the event.  I never noticed it before (maybe a case of not seeing the forest for the trees), but jazz gigs typically follow a common structure and share a set of common traits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It was scheduled to start at 8. Nobody was there at 8.  It started at 8:30.</li>
	<li>The band had obviously rehearsed 0 times for the gig. They didn&#8217;t know what songs they were going to play until right before each song started. Improvisation to the max.</li>
	<li>Without rehearsal or a set list, they picked songs that everyone knew. This means they picked the same songs we&#8217;ve all played a million times.</li>
	<li>They started with a bossa nova. They followed that with a waltz. Then (as I felt the same internal strife they apparently did) I heard the band leader say to the drummer, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what we should play next, but it should be a swing tune. We&#8217;ve already done a bossa and a waltz.&#8221;  Jazz people have an unwritten rule that you have to play a blues, something with a beat, a waltz, a ballad, and a swing tune in a set. It&#8217;s as if the set is not properly balanced otherwise and the jazz police will arrest them for producing an unbalanced set.</li>
	<li>They had someone sit in and played a song nobody else knew, so they all got the fakebooks out and read along.</li>
	<li>In every song, every band member played a solo in the same order.  In every song at the end of the solos, the saxophone played &#8220;traded fours&#8221; with the drummer.  Trading fours is when an instrumentalist improvises for four measures and then the band drops out for the drummer to improvise for four measures, until they get once or twice through the form of the tune. I can count the number of instances of trading fours I&#8217;ve enjoyed as a listener on the fingers of one hand.</li>
	<li>After the &#8220;last song&#8221; before the break, they played the standard set break tune, which is a song originally done by Miles Davis that sounds like the closing tag of a circus show. I can&#8217;t remember the name of it, and they probably can&#8217;t either. It&#8217;s meant to be transitional music over which the band says &#8220;thank you and we&#8217;ll be right back&#8221; but it usually lasts 5 minutes or more. It lasted 5 minutes or more.</li>
	<li>The entire band ran immediately outside to smoke.</li>
	<li>We left, but they probably took a break that lasted nearly as long as they had played.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a whole lot of ritual. And the funny thing is that I bet none of the band members enjoy most of it and I know the audience doesn&#8217;t care about any of it. The whole routine is constrained by a set of rules that aren&#8217;t done in the name of either the customer (audience) or the supplier (musician). They&#8217;re done for no one.</p>
<p>I have done all of these things countless times and I have not ever enjoyed the constraints. It&#8217;s only now that I&#8217;ve been away from it that I realize the constraints even exist.</p>
<p>I wonder what sort of things I do now that hindsight will reveal to be pointless ritual.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently been revisiting my musical roots.  I recently visited the home of my dormant music career (Memphis, TN) and spent time former band-mates and collaborators.  I&#8217;ve been also been dipping back into the jazz and classical composition worlds, learning who&#8217;s new on the scene and rediscovering old favorites.</p>
<p>Something has stood out as I&#8217;ve been browsing through online material connecting the dots again.  It&#8217;s a part of the culture I took for granted as a musician but which now feels sort of foreign. Musicians often talk about each other (and even themselves) in terms of their influences.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003182/Eric-Dolphy.html">example</a>:</p>
Among Dolphy&#8217;s early influences were Charlie Parker and the sounds of nature.
<p>It&#8217;s also common to talk about who <em>taught</em> you as a musician.  Here&#8217;s a snippet from my <a href="http://www.parkerandersonjazz.com/parker/">college roommate/bandmate&#8217;s bio</a>:</p>
<pre>
Chris Parker was born in North Little Rock, Arkansas. He first learned from local Arkansas musicians, most notably:   
Charles Thomas, Art Porter, Sr., Bob Steele, Lee Tomboulian, and Michael Bates. Chris moved to Memphis, TN in 1991. 
There he received his BA degree from the University of Memphis and learned from/ studied with musicians including Gene
 Rush, James Williams, Herman Green, Fred Ford, Calvin Newborn, Bill Mobley, Alvin Fielder, Kidd Jordan, Joe Jennings, and 
Vernel Fournier.
</pre>
<p>This creates a strong emphasis on creating a <em>tradition</em> which is carried forward and evolve generationally.  Jazz is a fairly new genre but here&#8217;s an example &#8220;family tree&#8221; of jazz: Lester Young <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician_timeline.php?id=11573">was influenced early on by Frankie Trambauer</a>.  Dexter Gordon was heavily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Gordon">influenced by Lester Young</a>.  Dexter Gordon was in turn the biggest influence on a young <a href="http://www.jazzreview.com/articledetails.cfm?ID=2166">Virginia Mayhew</a>.</p>
<p>So we have Frankie &#8594; Lester &#8594; Dexter &#8594; Virginia &#8594; ???</p>
<p>This visible passing on of tradition not only conveys a pride in the craft, but it gives listeners an understanding of what to expect when approaching a new artist. Not a completely road map but at least some clues.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/my-job-went-to-india">My Job Went to India</a> I wrote about standing on the shoulders of giants in our industry. Musicians make explicit which giants they&#8217;re standing on the shoulders of. It strikes me as a bit of a shame that we don&#8217;t do that as programmers.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Being an organizers of Ruby conferences myself, I always enjoy going to the regional conferences.  I&#8217;ve been to the <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">Mountain West RubyConf</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyhoedown.com/">Ruby Hoedown</a> and <a href="http://site.locaweb.com.br/railssummit/default.asp?language=7">Rails Summit Latin America</a>.  Each was excellent in its own unique way. It&#8217;s also a great pleasure for me to attend a conference I&#8217;m not organizing.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m looking forward to the upcoming <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/">Scotland on Rails</a> in March.  <a href="http://marcelmolina.com">Marcel</a> and I will be presenting a tutorial for charity at this year&#8217;s conference.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard great things about last year&#8217;s Scotland on Rails, and I trust my friends in Scotland to put on an excellent show.  If you haven&#8217;t been to Edinburgh, you owe yourself a trip.  It&#8217;s an incredibly beautiful city.</p>
<p>What better way to explore new lands than to do it by invitation as a speaker?  Scotland on Rails has opened its <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/proposals.html">Call for Proposals</a> (it&#8217;s been open for a while, but I&#8217;m slow).  The <span class="caps">CFP</span> closes in 2 weeks (December 1st), so if you&#8217;re interested in speaking don&#8217;t be late.  From what <a href="http://www.cardboardsoftware.com/">Alan</a> tells me, they are especially interested in hearing how to do <span class="caps">BIG</span> projects with Ruby and Rails.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> is only a little over 2 weeks away. Time flies!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">series of interviews with speakers</a> leading up to the conference.</p>
<p>This time is <a href="http://blog.bleything.net/">Ben Bleything</a>.  Ben is going to be speaking at RubyConf about <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/83">Ruby and Music</a></p>
<h2>What are you currently doing with Ruby and music?</h2>
<p>This is going to be a recurring theme, so I&#8217;ll get it out of the way<br />
here.  I think of myself more as a toolsmith than an actual creator.<br />
I&#8217;m not doing anything with Ruby and music per se&#8230; I&#8217;m trying to<br />
create tools for other people to use.</p>
<p>My creativity manifests in such a way that I&#8217;m actually pretty bad at<br />
creating &#8220;art&#8221;.  I&#8217;m a semi-failed musician, and I don&#8217;t have any<br />
illusions about programming being the path to making sweet, sweet music.<br />
I just think it&#8217;s an interesting problem to solve.</p>
<p>I have this vision of showing up at RubyConf in 2010 and having people<br />
using the stuff that Giles and Yossef and myself and others create to<br />
make some rad music.</p>
<h2>You spoke about Ruby and electronics last year.  How did you get into electronics?  What got you excited about it?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been into electronics since I was 12 or 13.  I was the kid who<br />
always took stuff apart.  I started frequenting my neighborhood Radio<br />
Shack around 14, building little lighty-uppy things and noisemakers and<br />
the like.  I grew bored of that pretty quickly, but I got back into it<br />
after college around the time that the Arduino came out.</p>
<p>One of the things that draws me to programming in general is the feeling<br />
of empowerment.  It&#8217;s really cool to be able to make a computer do<br />
your nefarious bidding.  Now apply that feeling to a physical device<br />
and you&#8217;re talking about a whole different level of that empowerment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said before that I feel like I was born 40 years too late&#8230; that I<br />
should have been hacking in the &#8216;60s.  Programming for microcontrollers<br />
is, in a lot of ways, as close as I can get to that.  Starting with bare<br />
metal and building an application, even if it&#8217;s as simple as blinking a<br />
light (the hello world of electronics) is deeply satisfying.</p>
<h2>Being into electronics, have you ever tried to build your own electronic instrument or have the computer play a real instrument with motors?</h2>
<p>Not yet, no.  Both are interesting ideas but getting close to requiring<br />
actual musical knowledge, and that&#8217;s where I start to get scared :)</p>
<p>I am playing around with hooking up video game instruments (think Rock<br />
Band and Guitar Hero) to a computer.  This sounds pretty mundane, and I<br />
guess that it is&#8230; but the trick is that I&#8217;ll be passing those through<br />
Ruby in order to provide the instruments with a bit more intelligence.</p>
<p>I guess the bottom line is that I&#8217;m much more interested in building<br />
systems (hardware or software) that more experienced musicians can use<br />
as tools&#8230; which brings us back to the toolsmith point above.</p>
<h2>Can computers generate beautiful music?  Dance beats seem easy. What about jazz improvisations?  Classical music?  Pop songs?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that a computer <strong>can</strong> generate beautiful music, but I think it<br />
would be mostly coincidental.  I&#8217;m still undecided on whether you can<br />
program a computer to <strong>always</strong> generate beautiful music.  It surely<br />
happens by chance sometimes, though.</p>
<p>I suspect that there&#8217;s interesting results waiting down the path of<br />
doing things like markov chaining with music instead of text.  Analyzing<br />
and chaining music is a significantly more complex problem than doing it<br />
with words, but my gut says with the right corpus, you could get some<br />
pretty interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, though, I think music has to have soul to be truly great.<br />
I want everyone to try to prove me wrong, though!</p>
<h2>Ruby, electronics, and music is a lot of ground to cover.  Are you passionate and excited about anything else in particular outside of these?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m passionate and excited about everything that catches my interest,<br />
honestly.  I&#8217;ve just chosen not to focus any energy on anything else<br />
right now.  I want to find ways to share my experience with others&#8230; to<br />
get people excited about doing the things they thought were too hard.</p>
<p>My electronics presentation last year is a prime example of that.  This<br />
stuff isn&#8217;t difficult, it&#8217;s just intimidating.  If I can lower the<br />
barrier to entry, either by educating or providing tools, then I feel<br />
like I&#8217;ve done my job.  I&#8217;m really hoping that my talk this year will do<br />
the same for the people interested in music.</p></div>
