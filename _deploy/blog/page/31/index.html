  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just switched to what I think is the 5th piece of software that<br />
I&#8217;ve used to power this site since its inception. Unlike every other<br />
switch I&#8217;ve made, this one is done because it&#8217;s <b>better</b><br />
than the others. I can say that with a clear conscience, because I&#8217;ve<br />
personally written almost all of the software that has run this site, and I<br />
know that the motivation behind almost every other switch I&#8217;ve made<br />
is nothing more than boredom and the desire to try something new.</p>
<p>
<p><a href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a> is written in Ruby<br />
(<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>), which has been<br />
a constant for me for the past two years. It supports <span class="caps">CVS</span>, categories, and<br />
multiple different file formats. Have a look here: <a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind is that, though my site is ugly,<br />
it&#8217;s always been ugly. You can&#8217;t blame this on <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a>&#8217;s creator<br />
(although if you think Dave&#8217;s site is ugly, you can blame <b>that</b><br />
on him). :)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I can upload MS Word<br />
documents and have them appear as weblog entries. Not because I want to use<br />
Word, but because it&#8217;ll be cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been sitting in front of my laptop all day taking some time off after 3 weeks of being physically ill in Budapest.  Kelly and Ramesh are outside playing chess (a new found passion for Kelly).  I&#8217;m starting to squint at the screen as the sun goes down on Bangalore and my house, but I dormantly refuse (or, rather, I don&#8217;t have the motivation) to get up and turn on a light.<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve been sitting here all day trying to do something productive.  Those that know me pretty well wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised to hear me say that I&#8217;m challenged when it comes to attention span.  Recently, someone at work asked me how I manage to be so productive and to involve myself in so many things in life (citing speaking Indian languages, playing music, writing books, programming recreationally, etc.).  Here&#8217;s the secret&#8230;<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve always had a short attention span.  This is probably just a lame excuse,<br />
but I think it&#8217;s genetic.  So, my approach to trying to remain useful despite<br />
this limitation is something akin to the Shotgun Approach.  In any given day,<br />
I&#8217;ll have 2-10 new ideas of things I want to do or try to involve myself in.<br />
Rather than stopping myself and trying to focus, I try <strong>all</strong> of them.  If I&#8217;m<br />
lucky, I&#8217;ll &#8220;hit something&#8221; with one of those shotgun pellets.  This way, when<br />
a <a
href="http://www.wyrdsmiths.com/index.php?fid=xt_picker&callfid=xt_gumption">gumption trap</a> comes along&#8212;a problem I can&#8217;t solve, software that won&#8217;t compile, realizing just how ignorant and incapable I might be, etc.&#8212;I can just switch gears to something more do-able.  This context switching might happen hourly, daily, or even every few minutes.  It depends on a potentially infinite number of factors that I can&#8217;t understand (currently) and therefore make no attempt to control.  At the end of the day (or, more accurately, &#8220;epoch&#8221;), the shotgun approach usually has done enough damage to at least draw a little blood.  These &#8220;bleeding&#8221; items are the ones I remember next time I sit down and restart the cycle, leaving the others to carry on without me interfering with them.  So, effectively, I probably start about 10 times more things than I finish.<br />
<P><br />
Today, I&#8217;ve been shooting blanks.  So, though I&#8217;ve been focusing intently on several different activities, I haven&#8217;t made progress in any of them.  Thankfully, this doesn&#8217;t happen too often.  But, when it does, it sure is a demotivating experience.<br />
<P><br />
As an experiment, here&#8217;s a list of things that I&#8217;ve currently got the shotgun pointing at.  I can check back here in a month or so, and see how many are still in sight.<br />
<UL><br />
<LI><a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf 2004</a></LI><br />
<LI>&lt;a href=&#8220;http://fit.c2.com&#8221;</a>Fit</a> (see my last post)</LI><br />
<LI><a href="http://www.apple.com">Getting a Mac</a>, and specifically involving myself in <a href="http://www.imasy.or.jp/~hisa/mac/rubycocoa/">Ruby Cocoa</a> development</LI><br />
<LI>Starting my own record label for jazz music</LI><br />
<LI>Exploring the concept of &#8220;executable documentation&#8221; in more detail with my own Ruby project</LI><br />
<LI>Trying to write a parser/interpreter for <span class="caps">SQL</span> in Ruby in support of the previous idea (though, it&#8217;s separate enough that it could succeed or fail independently)</LI><br />
<LI>Exploring and documenting Ruby internals</LI><br />
<LI>Veena</LI><br />
<LI>Hindi</LI><br />
<LI>Reviving my skills on the Saxophone with the soprano sax I recently purchased here in India</LI><br />
<LI>Kannada</LI><br />
<LI>My job (I don&#8217;t have much choice on this one)</LI></p>
</UL>
<P>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the whole list, but I got tired of typing. ;)  I think I&#8217;ll be sufficiently embarrassed to see how I&#8217;ve fared with even a subset.<br />
<P><br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  I&#8217;m not complaining.  So far, this has worked out pretty well for me.  I just thought I&#8217;d explain it here for the sake of 1) people who have to work with me in these conditions or just have to tolerate listening to me rapidly change directions all the time, and&#8212;the minority&#8212;2) people who actually want to know how/why I get involved in as many &#8220;projects&#8221; as I do.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on finishing my last day in Budapest.  Strangely, I&#8217;ve been sick (in the stomach) since the day I arrived in Budapest.  Most people would say that&#8217;s a bit backward, considering the fact that I&#8217;m coming from India.  Oh well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting experience.  I&#8217;ve met a lot of Hungarian people in my 3 weeks here.  Hardcore interviewing is a good way to rapidly learn a lot about a new culture.  I came here thinking Budapest was a lot like America.  I leave thinking it&#8217;s more like India.  I must have learned a lot (or been mislead).</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m sitting in my hotel room feeling nauseous.  I&#8217;m on the 4th floor (which in this country + hotel means I&#8217;m six stories up), looking out my Danube-facing window.  It&#8217;s snowing heavily.  Huge chunks of snow are falling from the building above me, and interestingly, snow flakes are falling &#8220;up&#8221; past my window.  Must be something about the air pressure, shape of the building, and the heat escaping.  Either that or I&#8217;m sicker than I thought.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning at 4AM, I&#8217;ll leave the hotel for a quiet I-don&#8217;t-speak-Hungarian ride in the taxi to the airport.  On the way here, I wore a short-sleeve shirt and froze when I reached Frankurt to find the airport employees (especially the ones who drive the bus from the plane to the terminal) on strike.  Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll over compensate and probably be miserably hot when I reach Bangalore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick and tired but very happy to be headed &#8220;home&#8221;.  Where is &#8220;home&#8221;?  Where ever <a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> is.  May sound sappy, but I&#8217;ve realized since I&#8217;ve been here, that I would feel more at home in Iraq with Kelly than I would in Arkansas by myself.  You might call this codependent, but I think that&#8217;s what marriage should feel like.</p>
<p>Room service just showed up.  With only about 4 things on the room service<br />
menu here, I&#8217;ve been eating the same thing almost every day.  Wienerschnitzel<br />
with french fries has been a consistent &#8220;favorite&#8221;.  Though I&#8217;ve been trying<br />
since I got here, today is the first day I&#8217;ve managed to get them to show up with ketchup.  I wonder if the Heinz ketchup is <i>supposed</i> to taste like vinegar here.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having been out of the <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com">XP</a> fray for some time, I just stumbled across <a href="http://fit.c2.com">Fit</a>.  It has always bothered me that almost all of the XP practices are very prescriptive in nature, but nobody seems to have anything useful to say about <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTests">Acceptance Tests</a>.  While the dogmatists argue about what to call it (<a href="http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?CoachingTests">1</a>,<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTest">2</a>,<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?CustomerTest">3</a>) it&#8217;s nice to see that someone has also been trying to do something to come up with a generalized solution.<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;re there yet, but there are some things about this that really appeal to me.  Perhaps most notably is the fact that they are using a document as the data source for a test suite.  While you document a requirement, you&#8217;re also coding an automated test suite for the requirement.  I&#8217;ve always liked the idea of &#8220;executable requirements&#8221;, though it lives in my (and others&#8217;) mind as an ideal, and I have yet to see it really implemented.  Unfortunately, it looks like you still have to write actual code to accompany each set of test cases you create, but I&#8217;ll consider the jury to be out until I see <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave">Dave&#8217;s</a> Ruby version.  I haven&#8217;t thought too much about it yet, but deep inside I want to believe that there is a way to create a framework that would enable this kind of thing with no coding required.<br />
<P><br />
At any rate, I&#8217;m glad to see some movement in this area.  And it&#8217;s got me thinking a lot about other opportunities for executable documentation.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in my previous post, this weekend was our 5th wedding anniversary.   We decided to go back to a <a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org/images/india/bandipur/bandipur.html">familiar place</a> for some peace and quiet (you don&#8217;t get much peace and quiet in a city like Bangalore).  We checked into the Hotel Monarch the night before our anniversary.  The next morning, we got up, took a short, scenic drive and came back.  The dogs were with us, so we each went upstairs into our cabin and picked up a dog to carry down for some &#8220;business&#8221;.  <BR><BR>Around step 2 (from the top), my feet slipped out from under me, and I found my body sliding ungracefully down while the back and right side of my head bounced behind it against each of the steps.  Luckily (for Shrenik), I instinctively wrapped my arms around the dog and let my back take a beating without attempting to break the fall with my arms.  Shrenik got away unscathed.<BR><BR>Somehow, I went from downward motion on my back to kneeling at the bottom of the stairs (still holding the dog), groaning and wondering if anything was broken.  It was hurting pretty bad, but I finally decided there was nothing seriously wrong and, after handing the dog to Kelly, got up to brush off the dirt.  <BR><BR>Kelly was talking to me, asking if I was OK.  At first, I was saying &#8220;yes&#8221;.  But, seconds later, I was seeing white spots that looked like a flock of birds, and her voice was muted like the sound of someone screaming underwater.  She forced me to sit back down on one of the lower steps of the staircase, which I reluctantly did (there were a bunch of ants there).  She kept saying, &#8220;Do you remember what day it is?  It&#8217;s our anniversary&#8221;, which I thought was strange.  Of course it was our anniversary.  Of course I remembered.  I started to drift off a little, Hindi fragments streaming through my constantly running background thought process, trying to piece together valid sentences that would adequately represent what I was thinking.<BR><BR>In complete darkness, I was on the verge of a breakthrough in my understanding of and ability to speak Hindi, when I was interrupted by the pleasant and seemingly cheerful sound of Kelly waking me up.  At the time, it sounded like any typical morning wakeup call.  I&#8217;d been &#8220;sleeping&#8221; comfortably for what seemed like hours.  It turns out it was only around 30 seconds.  And, my &#8220;bed&#8221; was the wooden, ant-covered stairway up to our cabin.  Apparently, I had started to slur my speech, my body stiffened up, my head started rolling around (eyes still open), and I fell half-way through the staircase railing.  I hung and flailed from the staircase while Kelly screamed at me to wake up and at Ramesh to come from his cabin to help.  I would have slid down for another blow to the head (this time head-first) if Kelly hadn&#8217;t been holding on the whole time.  <BR><BR>When I woke up, everything was red and moving like a strobe light.  I strained my eyes, but could only make out a portion of what was in front of me.  Sound came in and out of the muffled state like a pair of burnt up computer speakers.  Kelly ran to get Ramesh, so I wrapped the dog leashes around my arms in case I passed out again (which I did, I think).<BR><BR>  Eventually a couple of the hotel staff members were there with Kelly and Ramesh, helping to get me to the car.  I wasn&#8217;t fully with it yet.  I remember telling Raju, one of the hotel workers, (In Hindi) that I was sorry for being so big and that if I fell on him, we&#8217;d both be in trouble.<BR><BR> We all rode into the small town of Masinagudi, where there is a catholic &#8220;hospital&#8221;.  The best comparison I can make for the American reader is that it was something like the office space of an American small town gas station.  We had to wait a few minutes while the doctor finished praying.  When she returned, she spoke a lot of Tamil, took my blood pressure, touched my arms a lot, and finally declared that my blood pressure was low and she was going to give me an injection.  Kelly asked questions until we were appeased enough to go ahead with the injection, but we&#8217;re still not exactly sure what it was.  &#8220;Beta&#8221;-something-or-other, I think.  They gave me the shot in the top of the hand, which I always hate.  The doctor also &#8220;prescribed&#8221; (prescriptions aren&#8217;t generally necessary in India) some tablets to help with the pain.  The entire hospital experience set us back about $1.<BR><BR>I guess the moral of the story is that you should always hold the railing when on the stairs.  I know <I>I</i> did for the rest of the weekend.<BR><BR>All that aside, it was a really nice trip.  We saw two new animals this time: A black mongoose and a black bear.  We also had some closer elephant encounters, which made both Kelly and Ramesh pretty nervous.  I continued my unbroken losing streak of chess games against Ramesh (one of which was lost in something like 5 turns).  There was rioting all along Mysore road (dispute over who gets water from the river), so we had a slightly longer and bumpier ride home from the forest this morning.  We passed a town along the way where the police were apparently on the verge of catching the infamous Robin-Hood-esque <a href="http://www.news.sify.com/cgi-bin/sifynews/news/content/news_fullstory_v2.jsp?article_oid=11907704&category_oid=-20612&page_no=1">Veerapan</a>.<BR><BR>An eventful trip, but I&#8217;m glad to be back in Bangalore.</p></div>
