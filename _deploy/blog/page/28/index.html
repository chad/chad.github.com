  <div class="article-content"><p>I just finished reading Paul Graham&#8217;s fascinating essay, &quot;The<br />
Hundred-Year Language&quot; (<a
href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html</a>).<br />
Having recently spent some time on this topic myself, it was really<br />
interesting to read his views on the evolution of programming languages and<br />
the direction that he thinks things will move in the next century.</p>
<p>
<p>In my recent post on <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/LanguageEvolution.html,v">LanguageEvolution</a>,<br />
I mentioned that (spoken/written) language evolution is influenced by<br />
social factors. Language features suggesting affluence often win the<br />
evolutionary fight as speakers strive to sound more &quot;cultured&quot; or<br />
intelligent. Paul Graham has the following to say about programming<br />
language research:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   Research imposes constraining caste restrictions. In any academic field
   there are topics that are ok to work on and others that aren't.
   Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable and forbidden topics
   is usually based on how intellectual the work sounds when described
   in research papers, rather than how important it is for
   getting good results.
</pre>
<p>
<p>So, social factors seem to be affecting language designers as well. If it<br />
doesn&#8217;t show &quot;intellectual affluence&quot;, it&#8217;s<br />
apparently (according to Graham) not likely to show up in research. In this<br />
same section, Graham says that he is excited that many new languages are<br />
being created by &quot;hackers&quot; these days (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.)<br />
and that there are some innovative ideas coming out of these languages. In<br />
the context of computing history, this represents a step toward empowerment<br />
on a wider scale. Not quite &quot;the masses&quot;, but closer.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re at all interested in this kind of thing, the full article<br />
is definitely worth a read.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>What if human languages didn&#8217;t evolve as they do, but instead, all language change was centralized and controlled by expert linguists?  Would we be able to communicate with even half the level of expressiveness and creativity that we do now?  I don&#8217;t know of any natural languages whose complete vocabularies and rule-sets have been successfully codified and documented.  Sure, we have dictionaries and grammar books, but ultimately these serve only as a starting point from which experience and learning have to fill in the gaps.  So far, natural language has proven to be too expressive and complex to, for example, allow us to create computer programs capable of parsing and understanding it.<br />
<P><br />
I started thinking a lot about this after reading Steven Pinker&#8217;s <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&isbn=0060958332&TXT=Y&itm=1">The Language Instinct</a>, followed by <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&isbn=0060958405&itm=1">Words and Rules</a>.  While in Barcelona, I was lucky enough to discover and purchase a copy of Jean Aitchison&#8217;s excellent exploration of language evolution, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/results.asp?TTL=Language+Change+Progress+or+Decay&userid=2TLSUZ2VRE">Language Change: Progress or Decay?</a>.  Her thesis is that language change represents both progress <i>and</i> decay, and that it&#8217;s a natural process which should be no more questionable than the evolution of a species.<br />
<p><br />
Some of the major points from <span class="caps">LCP</span>:oD &#8211; <br />
<ul><br />
<li>Language change is, like most natural phenomena, decentralized in nature.  Attempts, such as those made by the French government, to &#8220;command and control&#8221; language evolution have proven to be futile.<br />
<li>Change usually creeps in as an exploitation of weakness in a language.  Examples are certain combinations of sounds in varieties of the English language which have combined into one <i>(jump-ed &#8594; jump&#8217;d)</i>, morphed <i>(spoilt &#8594; spoiled)</i>, or disappeared completely over time <i>(Cockney&#8217;s bottom &#8594; bo&#8217;om)</i>.<br />
<li>Most language changes beget compression and increased efficiency for the speaker.<br />
<li>Once a change is introduced, its spread is often influenced by social factors.  For example, a manner of speech which suggests a higher social status will spread quickly in middle and lower class communities.<br />
<li>While language change is natural and inevitable, it is sometimes socially undesirable.  Excessive change may be inconvenient if it linguistically divides two or more communities that were once able to communicate with each other.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>What if computer programming languages <i>could</i> evolve, and progress in programming language technology <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> centralized and controlled by expert computer scientists?  How much more expressively and efficiently could we communicate with computers&#8212;and with the programmers who have to read and modify our code?<br />
<p><br />
There is, of course, the matter of practical reality getting in the way of something like this immediately happening.  The biggest challenge is that we have to communicate both with humans <i>and</i> with computers.  If computers were smart enough to handle an ever-evolving language, we probably wouldn&#8217;t still have a field of research called Computational Linguistics.<br />
<p><br />
How could you make evolutionary program language &#8220;design&#8221; work?  The easiest answer is to say that it already does&#8230;to some extent.  Bjarne Stroustrup once <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201700735/qid=1049645974/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/002-9394931-1863239">said</a> that:<br />
<pre><br />
&#8220;Library design is language design&#8221;<br />
</pre><br />
By this, he meant that APIs are like little languages that represent a specific domain.  Each has its own &#8220;manner of speech&#8221;, so to speak.  If this is true, then you could easily see how the same compression, efficiency and social status drivers that affect language change could impact the way APIs are designed or even how programming styles differ from programmer to programmer.<br />
<p><br />
You can be sure that, when designing <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz</a> never directly intended for his language to lead to the following manner of programming:<br />
<pre><br />
a=&#8216;p=0;t=&quot;&quot;*30000;&#8217;;$&lt;.each_byte{|c|a&lt;&lt;({?&gt;=&gt;&quot;p+=1;&#8220;,?&lt;=&gt;&#8221;p-=1;&quot;,?<ins>=&gt; &quot;t[p]</ins>=1;<br />
&#8220;,?-=&gt;&#8221;t[p]-=1;&#8220;,?[=&gt;&#8221;while t[p]&gt;0;&#8220;,?]=&gt;&#8221;end;&#8220;,?.=&gt;&#8221;putc t[p];<br />
&#8220;, ?,=&gt;&#8221;t[p]=<span class="caps">STDIN</span>.getc||0;&#8220;}||&#8221;&#8220;)};eval a<br />
</pre><br />
And, there&#8217;s definitely a big difference between this code snippet and the following example of how to create a sidebar in the (also Ruby-based) &#8221;http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog&quot;&gt;software</a> that powers this website:<br />
<pre><br />
LinkHolder.new(&#8220;Some Links&#8221;,<br />
        &#8220;http://www.rubycentral.org&#8221;          =&gt; &#8220;Ruby Central&#8221;,<br />
        &#8220;http://www.chadfowler.com&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;Chad Fowler&#8221;,<br />
	&#8220;http://languagehat.blogspot.com&#8221;              =&gt; &#8220;Artima&#8221;<br />
)<br />
</pre><br />
They&#8217;re both Ruby, but the similarities stop there.  I&#8217;d go so far as to say that the first program (which happens to be an <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/ABetterOok.rdoc">interpreter</a> for an obfuscated programming language) is no more immediately understandable to the average Ruby programmer than Spanish is to the average English speaker.  Though you might not go so far as to say these are two different <i>languages</i>, it wouldn&#8217;t be too far off base to think of them as two different <i>dialects</i>.  It would be interesting to know how much <span class="caps">API</span> design and dominant programming style affect the designers of languages and ultimately, though indirectly, set the future direction of programming language design.  Maybe there is a touch of evolution indirectly guiding our language designs.<br />
<p><br />
As I said, the &#8220;Library design is language design&#8221; argument gives us an easy answer.  We see in its evolution the same kind of subtle innovation that we see in spoken language.  But, the world of computing is rarely characterized as being a breeding ground for <i>subtle</i> innovation.<br />
<p><br />
In a <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a/3369">recent interview</a>, Alan Kay, the inventor of Smalltalk, said that &#8220;People today aren&#8217;t doing a lot of work to move programming to its next phase.&#8221;  He&#8217;s disappointed to see that innovations he and his team made in the early 70s <i>still</i> seem &#8220;modern&#8221; today.  Similarly, at MIT&#8217;s <a href="http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/">Lightweight Languages Workshop 2002</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s Todd Proebsting <a href="http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/talks/proebsting.ppt">argued</a> that the industry needs to start looking at &#8220;Disruptive Programming Language Technologies&#8221; (read: non-linear innovation) and stop focusing on optimization (beating) of the same old paradigm (near-dead horse).<br />
<p><br />
So, maybe there&#8217;s something to be said for changing the way we go about designing programming languages.<br />
<p><br />
Having said all this, I still don&#8217;t have much of an idea of how to overcome the practical problems of decentralized programming language evolution.  But, here are a few thoughts for starters:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><i>Learn from our syntax errors.</i>  What are the most common mistakes that programmers make?  Why?  In some cases, it might be carelessness, but if you could capture all of the mistakes made in the world of, for example, Java programming, there might be some patterns that show us a &#8220;weakness&#8221; that could be exploited.  If you think about it, programming errors are an important source of feedback to the language designer that are currently being lost by the ton each day.  How different might Java look if Sun could just see how often I screw up my Java programs because of all of those damned parentheses I generate having to type-cast everything?<br />
<li><i>Bring language design to the masses</i> in the same way that the Quake engine brought 3D game design to thousands of college freshman with too much free time.  Surely there has to be a more user-friendly tool for language implementation than Bison or Antlr.    Maybe we&#8217;ll look back 15 years from now and laugh about how hard it used to be to make a new language in the same way that we look back now and laugh about how hard it used to be to do what Excel makes simple today.<br />
<li><i>Actually build an adaptive interpreter or compiler.</i>  By this, I mean an interpreter that will learn from programmers&#8217; mistakes and adapt to nuances in programmers&#8217; styles.  <a href="http://www.asd.k12.ak.us/Schools/Bartlett/academics/HIP/Gumptionology/Pages/Value_rigidity.html">Value rigidty</a> mixed with a healthy respect for reality make this one pretty tough to swallow, but as Proebsting says in his &#8220;Disruptive Programming Language Technologies&#8221; talk (not in so many words), the disruptive technologies of the future are the ones that seem ridiculous to us now.</p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>It would take someone a lot smarter and more patient than me to actually do anything with these ideas.  But, (as Jean Aitchison puts it) &#8220;social undesirability&#8221; aside, the idea of programming in Pidgin Java or SmallPerl# Creole appeals to me in an exciting and indescribable way.<br />

  <div class="article-content"><p>While surfing through my home directory on my laptop today, I realized that I have started many more since-abandoned (and forgotten) projects than I thought.  In February, I post <a href="/index.cgi/AttentionSpanChallenged.html">an explanation</a> of why this happens.  <br />
<p><br />
I looked through some of the code I had written and was alarmed to see that some of it actually works.  It would be a shame to let it be <i>completely</i> forgotten and go to permanent waste, so I&#8217;ve taken a step toward preserving the many project beginnings that I create.<br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;ve decided that all future potential throw-away projects will, instead of living on a <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository on my local PC, be maintained in a centralized <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository, located <a href="/viewcvs.cgi">here</a>.<br />
<p><br />
If you browse there now, you&#8217;ll see <a href="/viewcvs.cgi/jvm_analysis">today&#8217;s distraction</a>.  I&#8217;ve started adapting some of the code from <a href="http://www.namikilab.tuat.ac.jp/~sasada/prog/rava.html">Rava</a> (an attempt at a ruby-based Java Virtual Machine&#8212;no English documentation as far as I can tell) in an effort to create an automated code-review/analysis tool for Java projects.  I know such tools already exist, but they&#8217;re usually expensive and require you to write Java code or use a feature-limited <span class="caps">GUI</span> to create new rules.  I&#8217;m excited about the potential of expressing code review rules in a simple Ruby-based <span class="caps">API</span>-cum-domain-language.  <br />
<p><br />
I&#8217;ve been gradually refactoring Rava and removing things I don&#8217;t need over the course of the day.  So far, I haven&#8217;t added anything new, though it&#8217;s becoming less and less recognizable as Rava as the day moves on.  Another couple of hours&#8217; work should yield some preliminary code review functionality.  As of now, it just reads class files.  It really could use some unit tests, too.  This is the kind of thing that can quickly become read-only without tests.<br />
<p><br />
Sometime soon, I&#8217;ll try to get around to cleaning up the various other almost-projects sitting on my laptop and desktop PCs and import all of them.  Unfortunately, our internet connection is so dreadfully slow here in India that it&#8217;s a huge pain to check things in and out from my new repository.  Another month more, and we&#8217;ll be back to blazingly fast internet access that I&#8217;ll never take for granted again.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Over the past week, I&#8217;ve been playing around with <span class="caps">RSS</span> news<br />
aggregators. I think I&#8217;ve settled (for now) on Spaces (<a
href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com">www.dynamicobjects.com</a>).<br />
It&#8217;s actually a full email client/<span class="caps">PIM</span> as well as a news aggregator.<br />
What I really like about it is that the news posts trail in as messages in<br />
your inbox along with the actual emails. It&#8217;s nice to only have to<br />
look one place when I turn on my computer. And, when I search the messages<br />
in my inbox, it takes into account almost any online material I&#8217;m<br />
likely to have been reading.</p>
<p>
<p>Now, I just have to train myself not to open up my web browser and start<br />
visiting the sites for which I now <b>know</b> there are no updates. It<br />
sounds ridiculous, but I&#8217;ve been doing it consistently. This confirms<br />
the habitual nature of my internet-browsing behaviour.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also still been using AgentFrank (<a
href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank">www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank</a>)<br />
in combination with the aggregators. What I would <b>love</b> now is<br />
integration between something like Spaces and something like AgentFrank.<br />
I&#8217;m sure this idea would make a lot of people ill (especially the<br />
paranoid), but I would like for an AgentFrankish thing to discover what<br />
I&#8217;m looking at (repeatedly or based on semantic closeness to things I<br />
look at repeatedly) and then start pulling new items into a Spaces-esque<br />
aggregator without my asking it to. AgentFrank helps me to stop forgetting<br />
the interesting sites I find, and Spaces helps me to remember (or, more<br />
correctly, to not <b>have</b> to remember) to look at the interesting sites<br />
I know about. The combination of the two could be really powerful for a<br />
scatter-brained guy like me.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Today, Dave <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Artifacting.rdoc,v">questioned the emphasis</a> on nouns over verbs in software development.  This hit a nerve.<br />
<p><br />
The thought that most stands out to me is:<br />
<pre><br />
	Once I started thinking about this as a pattern, <br />
	it started to change the way I look at many of the <br />
	other artifacts we produce (including the <br />
	delivered programs themselves).<br />
</pre><br />
<P><br />
Some people say that programming is an art form.  This is significantly less popular than the programming-as-engineering metaphor, but assuming it has some merit, there seem to be some holes (or lessons-to-be-learned, perhaps) in the way we practice.  Without going into a full scale contrast between the practice of programming and, say, music, there is one particular aspect of practicing &#8220;art&#8221; which seems conspicuously missing from the every day work of the programmer.  As a musician, I might spend a significant portion of my practice schedule playing things that nobody would want to listen to.  This might include scales, arpeggios, extended tones (good for improving control on wind instruments, for example), and various technical patterns.  I would certainly never record them and release them on a CD.   I wouldn&#8217;t even bore anyone with these sounds unless they either lived in my house and had no choice or were being paid to listen to them and offer suggestions for improvement.  This is an example of &#8220;work&#8221; in which the action is far more valuable than the direct output.<br />
<P><br />
Musicians don&#8217;t just do these things in the early stages of their development.  They continue throughout their careers.  In my experience, the <i>specific</i> things they practice change over time, usually decreasing in stand-alone value with experience.  For example, one of my last saxophone teachers, <a href="http://cuneiformrecords.com/bandshtml/cartwright.html">George Cartwright</a>, spent a great deal of his practice time doing nothing but playing a single note and listening to it.  It would be absolutely unnerving to listen to if you weren&#8217;t George himself.  The way he played the notes didn&#8217;t even sound good.  But, the output wasn&#8217;t the point.  It was the act. <br />
<P><br />
Something I learned as a saxophonist is that the less valuable the direct output of that which you practice, the more emphasis you will place on the act of practicing.  I can learn more, for instance, from making horrid noises for 30 minutes than I can from learning a Charlie Parker solo and playing it from memory.  Why is this?  I&#8217;m so focused on the output of the Charlie Parker solo&#8212;making it sound good, feeling good as a result&#8212;that I forget to focus on the process of learning it, and important bits of information are liable to fall through the proverbial cracks.<br />
<P><br />
I started thinking about this about a year and a half ago, on my return trip from the first <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">International Ruby Conference</a>.  In software development, even for hobbyists like me, we&#8217;re almost always focused on creating something useful.  If software is simply a craft or an engineering discipline, this doesn&#8217;t seem strange, but if it&#8217;s an art, this is a big hole.  If I&#8217;m trying to make a cool new <span class="caps">CGI</span> program for my web site, I&#8217;m probably more interested in the feature I&#8217;m implementing than the fact that I&#8217;m implementing it.  Eric Raymond says that Open Source software &#8220;scratches an itch&#8221; of the programmer that creates it, meaning that the programmer finds something missing and creates software to fill the void.  And, of course, in commercial software development, we get paid to create something&#8212;not to learn how to code. <br />
<P><br />
Back to Dave&#8217;s point (though I wouldn&#8217;t guess that he was thinking <i>exactly</i> this), the emphasis is entirely on the artifact (in this case, the functioning piece of software) and not so much on the process of development.  From hobbyists to professionals, we&#8217;re all very focused on creating useful stuff.<br />
<P><br />
This is why I developed (among other less publishable &#8220;pieces&#8221;) <a href="http://chadfowler.com/ruby/rubyook/">Ruby Ook</a>, which is an interpreter for a language so useless that the language&#8217;s designer never bothered to write an interpreter or compiler for it.  I knew that in the end, it would take so long to write an Ook program, that I probably wouldn&#8217;t ever bother.  It was a perfect chance to write something that, though implementing a &#8220;requirement&#8221;, had an end result of almost no value.  It felt great.  I worked on it on and off during a single weekend and found myself scrapping bits, refactoring, testing everything&#8212;cutting no corners.  After all, why should you cut a corner when you don&#8217;t care if you ever get to your destination?  In the end, I had some code which I was extremely proud of.  Even if it&#8217;s useless, I knew that I hadn&#8217;t compromised in its creation.  And, even though the end result isn&#8217;t very big or impressive (even in terms of its internals), I learned a lot about how I think and program in the process.<br />
<P><br />
A few years ago, a friend of mine read an eastern philosophy book called (something like) <B>The Path With No Destination</B>.  At the time, it sounded like a pretty hokey title.  But, over the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve thought about it often.  I don&#8217;t even know what the book is about, but the title has taken on its own meaning to me.  Whether it&#8217;s music, programming, work, or life in general, you generally spend a lot more time on the &#8220;path&#8221; than you do at the &#8220;goal&#8221;.  Your experience will be richer and you&#8217;ll learn a lot more if you keep that in mind.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>After a delightfully thought provoking trip to the Joan Miro museum<br />
yesterday, I was sadly disappointed with our trip to the Museu Picasso<br />
today. If you&#8217;re going to Barcelona and plan to see both of these<br />
sites, I suggest you visit the Museu Picasso first. The bar was just raised<br />
too high by the Joan Miro museum.</p>
<p>
<p>The permanent exhibit was closed, but there was no sign that warned us of<br />
this before buying tickets. The security guards were ruthless and militant.<br />
The exhibition halls were narrow and crowded with obnoxious Americans who<br />
walked slowly from painting to painting and clumped in front of them to<br />
talk about unrelated pulp. And, finally, the entire area surrounding the<br />
museum smells like a sewer.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I left the museum feeling like:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t really like Picasso</li>
<li>He seemed to get worse and less interesting as he got older</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t really care to find out if I&#8217;m misguided about my<br />
opinion so far</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Kelly assures me that it&#8217;s more the museum&#8217;s fault than<br />
Picasso&#8217;s and that they neither adequately represented his evolution<br />
as an artist nor did they actually show many of his really good work. I<br />
believe her, and I&#8217;m sure the above will be a memory by tomorrow<br />
morning.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Something I forgot from yesterday is that I&#8217;ve found a new (for me)<br />
artist to follow up on. A French Surrealist named Yves Tanguy. I&#8217;ve<br />
always been a Salvador Dali fan&#8212;especially back when I was into Iron<br />
Maiden album cover art, and Tanguy&#8217;s paintings appeal to me in the<br />
same way Dali&#8217;s do.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to resist such a charming face:</p>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<p>This picture was taken in 1936. I wonder if this was a typical hair style<br />
for Paris in the 30s. :)</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Today, we visited the Fundacio Miro (<a
href="http://www.bcn.fjmiro.es">www.bcn.fjmiro.es</a>), which is<br />
deceptively close to our hotel. I say deceptively, because, while it was<br />
the shortest walk we&#8217;ve taken so far on this trip, it&#8217;s<br />
straight up hill from here. We made the mistake of this being the first<br />
morning that we&#8217;ve skipped breakfast, which made it extra<br />
frustrating. I can feel myself getting older. I can&#8217;t remember a time<br />
five years ago when I lamented not having eaten breakfast.</p>
<p>
<p>I really enjoy museums that are dedicated to a single artist. We saw works<br />
spanning from when Miro was eight years old to around the time he died.<br />
I&#8217;m far from what you would call an art enthusiast, and I&#8217;m<br />
horribly ignorant by most counts, but a format like this allows me to walk<br />
through and observe&#8212;in a very obvious way&#8212;how the artist<br />
changed over time.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is the second such museum I&#8217;ve visited&#8212;the first being the<br />
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (<a
href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl">www.vangoghmuseum.nl</a>). We made a<br />
failed attempt to see the Edvard Munch Museum (<a
href="http://www.museumsnett.no/munchmuseet">www.museumsnett.no/munchmuseet</a>)<br />
in Oslo, but after a long (and also fully uphill) walk, it was closed.<br />
Disappointing, but not nearly as much as our post-5-mile-walk view of the<br />
Brandenburg Gate (<a
href="http://www.dailysoft.com/east-berlin/mitte/bgate.htm">www.dailysoft.com/east-berlin/mitte/bgate.htm</a>),<br />
covered for construction and featuring a cartoonish, life sized<br />
<b>picture</b> of the monument.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Something I noticed as a potential pattern today is that many of the great<br />
20th century artists started off in realism and ended in the Avant Garde.<br />
This doesn&#8217;t apply to just painting, but also to music and writing<br />
(at least). A notable musical example is Albert Ayler (<a
href="http://www.ayler.supanet.com">www.ayler.supanet.com</a>), bebop-esque<br />
saxophonist who ended his career playing purely emotional, energized music<br />
rendered in a loose framework more reminiscent of the world&#8217;s<br />
national anthems than jazz standards, or Arnold Schoenberg, the founder of<br />
atonal music in the Western classical tradition. As I walked through the<br />
Miro museum, I thought a lot about why this happens. And&#8212;a longer<br />
topic I won&#8217;t get into&#8212;how this might apply to computer<br />
programming, if you buy into the idea that programming is an art form. More<br />
on this later&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Something that specifically caught my attention about Miro is that, as a<br />
lover of poetry, he wanted to find a way to express poetry through visual<br />
art. He was quoted (though I&#8217;m not sure of the exact quote nor the<br />
source since I read it in the museum) as saying that he both blurred the<br />
distinction between art and poetry and appreciated poetry in terms of its<br />
potential visual representations. I would normally dismiss this kind of<br />
talk as the pretentious ramblings of a self-obssessed &quot;Artiste&quot;,<br />
but Miro actually took some apparent steps to realize his desire to merge<br />
poetry and art. Over time (crystalizing in the early<br />
1930&#8217;s&#8212;which seems to be my favorite period of his work) he<br />
developed an iconographic vocabulary or &quot;visual language&quot; which<br />
formed the basis of most of his work for the rest of his life. With this<br />
&quot;language&quot;, he developed visual &quot;poems&quot; that presumably<br />
had some meaning beyond the abstract shapes, colors, and textures that we<br />
laypeople see when we look at them. I searched the museum book shop for a<br />
&quot;Miro Visual Phrasebook&quot; but didn&#8217;t find one (though we<br />
<b>did</b> find some placemats with pictures and their associated meanings<br />
in French). It&#8217;s possible (though beside the point, really) that<br />
I&#8217;m making more of this than Miro did, but the idea of a visual (or<br />
audial, for that matter) meta-language for embedding meaning in art has a<br />
definite appeal to the musician/computer-geek/wannabe-linguist in me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As a composer (of music), I was always annoyed by conversations that<br />
started with: &quot;What are you trying to <b>say</b> with this<br />
piece?&quot; <b>Nothing</b>. I&#8217;m not trying to say <b>anything</b>.<br />
It&#8217;s <b>music</b>, I thought. In fact, I was particularily impressed<br />
today by the fact that many of Miro&#8217;s paintings are titled<br />
&quot;Painting&quot;. In the same vein, my last piece of music was called<br />
&quot;Quartet&quot;. But, with Miro&#8217;s meta-language, maybe his<br />
paintings really <b>are</b> &quot;saying something&quot; in the literal<br />
sense. Why not? The challenge of marrying the encoded meaning and the<br />
aesthetic and more fuzzy aspects of the piece would be especially<br />
interesting. Maybe this is what David Morgan-Mar had in mind when he<br />
created the Piet Programming Language (<a
href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html">www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html</a>),<br />
in which programs are &quot;written&quot; as digital abstract art.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As an aside, there was one painting in the entire exhibit that drew my<br />
attention more than any other. I saw it from across the room and had to<br />
wait behind a crowd of people who were chatting before getting a close<br />
look. I was a bit surprised when Kelly read the title to me:</p>
</p>
<h1>Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement</h1>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/excrement.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t ya know I would pick a picture of excrement to be interested<br />
in.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Perhaps tomorrow we&#8217;ll tour the Picasso museum.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Following a thread from the previous post (/<a
href="index.cgi/Travel/Europe/Miro.rdoc,v">Travel/Europe/Miro</a>), I just<br />
stumbled across Basic English (<a
href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/basiceng.html">ogden.basic-english.org/basiceng.html</a>).<br />
Basic English is an attempt to deobfuscate the English language, primarily<br />
by reducing its vocabulary from the tens of thousands present in standard<br />
English to 850.</p>
<p>
<p>Basic English is a subset of English, complete with its grammatical<br />
exceptions and ambiguities. I wonder how much munging it would take to make<br />
an easily computer-parsable English. How strange would English have to look<br />
(to a human) for a computer to be able to understand it as well? I would<br />
really like to be able to search for articles on the web that contain, for<br />
example, negative opinions about a specific topic. Or how about: &quot;All<br />
pages which contradict the statement the following assertion&#8230;&quot;<br />
(followed by some English text which states something as fact). I&#8217;ve<br />
been thinking a lot lately about how to make this sort of things possible<br />
with standard English, but if English were disambiguously computer<br />
parsable, it would be simple.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The fact that Lojban (<a href="http://www.lojban.org">www.lojban.org</a>)<br />
is computer parsable (<a
href="http://www.lojban.org/resources/tools.html">www.lojban.org/resources/tools.html</a>)<br />
has always excited me, but I&#8217;m afraid that if I wrote my web posts in<br />
Lojban, nobody would read them.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Spur of the moment, we decided to take a vacation. Two days later,<br />
we&#8217;ve got tickets and hotel reservations in Barcelona.</p>
<p>
<p>Busy with work, I haven&#8217;t taken the time to learn <b>anything</b><br />
about what Spain will be like. I know two things:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve never been there before.</li>
<li>A lot of people will probably speak Spanish (though, in Barcelona, the<br />
predominant language seems to be Catalan (<a
href="http://www.june29.com/HLP/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html">www.june29.com/<span class="caps">HLP</span>/lang/Catalan/webcat1.html</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>(Are nested parentheses an intuitive construct for non-programming readers<br />
of English?)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I hope the Catalonians won&#8217;t be too offended if we try to speak<br />
Spanish to them. I don&#8217;t think we have time to learn Catalan.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, a week and a half from now, I&#8217;ll be back&#8212;hopefully<br />
refreshed and having risen my once-decent knowledge of basic Spanish from<br />
the dead. If there&#8217;s anything interesting to look at in Spain, I<br />
might even post a picture or two.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Hasta la vista.</p>
