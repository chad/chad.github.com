<div class="article-content">
  <p>For the first several years of my career in IT, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I&#8217;d rather be doing while at work. I might be in a meeting, talking about how to improve the uptime of a billing system. Or putting together time cards for a weekly report. Or programming in a language I knew wasn&#8217;t as good as the one I used at home when I was free.</p>
<p>I was frustrated. Not extremely frustrated most of the time. Just a little frustrated. Because there was always <em>something</em> I&#8217;d rather be doing than the job I spent the majority of my waking time on.</p>
<p>For me, the question of what I&#8217;d rather have been doing was answered roughly as such: working with people smarter than me using the best tools available to build something that solves real problems well. In my spare time, I worked on Open Source code in Ruby and collaborated with some of the smartest developers I&#8217;ve met. At work, I <em>wished</em> I was doing what I did in my spare time.</p>
<p>Within the structure of my job, there was yet another telling question with a telling answer. What job would I have rather been doing? For me and most of my co-workers, there was always that next job we were after. Someone was doing it and doing it poorly, and we wanted a chance. That&#8217;s how humans think, I guess.</p>
<p>So with these goals in sight, I made daily choices that were usually geared toward driving me toward achieving them. I wanted to work with Ruby, so I spent my free time learning Ruby from top to bottom. I read and tinkered with the interpreter source and experimented (and failed sometimes) with different styles of Ruby development, testing, an what-not. I wanted to work in a team that understood software development processes, so I practiced XP practices when possible and immersed myself in development practices such as Test Driven Development. I wanted to work with people smarter than me, so I befriended and collaborated with as many as I could&#8212;-again in free time until I could find the right opportunity to do it for work.</p>
<p>These investments paid off. In 2005, I moved out of the upwardly mobile corporate management job I was in and into a development position on a small, talented team of Ruby developers. I&#8217;ve gone from that to independent consulting to training and book writing to working with the team at <a href="http://infoether.com">InfoEther</a> (led by Rich Kilmer, one of those smarter-than-me people I mentioned earlier).</p>
<p>This month, as the expanded and renamed second edition of <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/my-job-went-to-india">my first book</a> is released, I find myself returning to the primary question that drove me to where I am today: What would I rather be doing? It&#8217;s weird, but for the first time I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>The title of the new book is <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</a>. The book covers the approach I and others who have inspired me have taken in creating a remarkable and satisfying career. It&#8217;s an expanded version of the first edition with not only new and revised content by me but essays by software developers who have inspired me throughout my career and a foreword by <a href="http://loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/cfcar2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I believe strongly that passion is the most important ingredient for creating a remarkable career and doing excellent work. That&#8217;s easy to say and probably not too hard to agree with, but it begs the question of what you should do if you&#8217;re <em>not</em> passionate about what you&#8217;re doing. How can you find your passion? What advice can I give to someone who hasn&#8217;t found it but wants to?</p>
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t know. But I think a good first step is to ask yourself the question: &#8220;What would I rather be doing right now?&#8221; And then, &#8220;Why is that not what I&#8217;m doing?&#8221;</p>
