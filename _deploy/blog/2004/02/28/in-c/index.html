<div class="article-content">
  <p>Since coming back from the MFASoftware program, I&#8217;ve been trying to<br />
stay focused on my remote assignments. I&#8217;ve been doing a<br />
particularily bad job of actually finishing anything, but I <b>have</b><br />
been learning a lot.</p>
<p>
<p>One of my assignments was to read and annotate Guy Steele&#8217;s Lambda<br />
The Ultimate Imperative (<a
href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">library.readscheme.org/page1.html</a>).<br />
I&#8217;ve read the paper twice and opened up an editor to write about it<br />
five or six times. As I read the paper, I knew it was teaching me something<br />
that was going to have a lasting effect, but somehow when I sat to write<br />
about it, the only memories I could summon were the mechanics of Scheme<br />
(which the paper is written in/using).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been learning Scheme in parallel to reading this paper, and<br />
I&#8217;ve definitely felt a lot of &quot;schemisms&quot; snap into place<br />
as I read. But I know that simply learning the language isn&#8217;t what<br />
this paper is about. It&#8217;s just so hard to separate learning the<br />
language from discovering the purity and simplicity of what Steele is<br />
demonstrating. The beauty of Scheme is that there&#8217;s hardly anything<br />
to it. To see Steele effortlessly implement programming constructs on top<br />
of this near-nothingness drives home the power of minimalism.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, now I realise that, above all else, it&#8217;s a fascination with<br />
minimalism that I&#8217;ve brought home from Illinois. <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3254253382">Apparently</a>,<br />
I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If minimalism is good, then what&#8217;s the opposite of minimalism?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I studied music composition with <a
href="http://www.kamranince.com">Kamran_Ince</a>, there was one thing I<br />
always knew he was going to say when I walked into his office with a new<br />
composition. He was going to tell me something like, &quot;You&#8217;ve got<br />
such a great idea here. Why do you have to run away from it so quickly? You<br />
didn&#8217;t develop it. We didn&#8217;t even know it happened!&quot; I<br />
would literally walk in to the beginning of a lesson <tt>knowing</tt> this<br />
was going to happen, and yet it would happen every time. It felt a little<br />
like not being able to spell &quot;<span class="caps">FBI</span>&quot; or like being given the<br />
answers to a test and then failing it anyway.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Though he wasn&#8217;t necessarily trying to encourage me to write music in<br />
the style of a minimalist, the lesson was in fact about minimalism as a<br />
craft element. And, if minimalism is good, then what I was bringing to<br />
Kamran each week was its opposite. Lots of good ideas, jammed into a very<br />
tiny temporal space. The end result was a jumble of intelligent thoughts,<br />
stepping all over each other so that none were ultimately recognizable.<br />
Have you tried to use <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/"><span class="caps">JDNI</span></a>? It was<br />
probably the musical equivalent. In the software world, this has the effect<br />
of both muddying up what is already there, and creating an environment that<br />
is unfriendly to extension and change.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the thing called &quot;minimalism&quot; in<br />
art-forms other than music. But, in music, one of minimalism&#8217;s key<br />
features is that of emergence. When players are making repetitive and<br />
rhythmic sounds, a la <a href="http://terryriley.com">Terry</a> <a
href="http://terryriley.com/">Reilly</a>, it&#8217;s almost never the<br />
<b>written</b> notes and rhythms that are interesting. It&#8217;s what<br />
happens when they&#8217;re all played together by imperfect humans.<br />
It&#8217;s the slow and subtle phase shifting, and then the<br />
musicians&#8217; subtle reactions to the phase shifting.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Scheme obviously creates an environment that encourages emergent behaviors.<br />
In fact, the whole point of Lambda the Ultimate Imperative (LtUI) is to<br />
show that Scheme can be an imperative language, without changing Scheme and<br />
without &quot;shoe-horning&quot; Scheme to awkwardly meet the imperative<br />
critera. LtUI happens to be written by one of Scheme&#8217;s designers, but<br />
there&#8217;s no reason you or I couldn&#8217;t have written that paper<br />
(other than my age at its time of publication).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, back to Kamran Ince. He was trying to teach me not just to keep my<br />
music simple so I could develop ideas. He was also trying to teach me to<br />
create powerful ideas. You can&#8217;t write music the &quot;Kamran<br />
Way&quot; while making timid gestures. If you&#8217;re going to let it all<br />
hang out with an idea, it better be strong.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And, with music, I think it&#8217;s a lot more apparent (than in<br />
programming) that you can&#8217;t start with an idea that doesn&#8217;t<br />
provide a platform on which to build a piece. For a patently contrived<br />
example, listen to <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/music/ThatsAllFolks.mp3">this</a>. It would be<br />
possible to build a piece of music on something that sounds so final, but<br />
it would sound strange and intentional. While the temporal element is<br />
missing, an extremely rigid language or an <span class="caps">API</span> that is too large and<br />
complex can produce the same effect of stunted idea growth in software. For<br />
(potentially inflamatory) example, if a method of an object can only accept<br />
parameters of a certain class, my freedoms are extremely and intentionally<br />
limited when using that object.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, &quot;good minimalism&quot; doesn&#8217;t require simply that we<br />
&quot;be minimal&quot;. It requires that we correctly balance substance and<br />
space in a way that encourages evolutionary growth. It is possible to be<br />
minimal and rigid, which will lead to small ideas that can&#8217;t be<br />
developed any further. This is rarely what we want. Minimalism is one of<br />
these words (like &quot;simple&quot;) that sound easy to do but actually<br />
require a lot of practice to get them right.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I see now that Lisp and Scheme aren&#8217;t different because of their<br />
minimal syntax or their dynamism. It&#8217;s the fact that they &quot;get<br />
out of the way&quot;, providing the right balance of mechanism and policy<br />
to allow their users to continue to evolve in the direction that nature<br />
selects, while not being so austere that wheels are necessariliy being<br />
reinvented every day. This is what has drawn me to Ruby (and Smalltalk and<br />
Scheme) and away from the likes of Java and C#. Not dynamic vs. static<br />
typing or compiled vs. interpreted environments.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Many of the arguments for and against these minimal environments seem to<br />
boil down to the Mechanism vs. Policy <a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/MechPolicy.rdoc">tradeoff</a>.<br />
But, I&#8217;ll leave that for a later post.</p>
