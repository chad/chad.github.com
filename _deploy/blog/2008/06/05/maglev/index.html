<div class="article-content">
  <p>We just wrapped up <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf 2008</a>.  A lot has been said about RailsConf elsewhere, so <br />
as the program chair I&#8217;ll just say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to the speakers, attendees, co-organizers, sponsors, and <br />
everyone else for making it the best conference I&#8217;ve ever been to.</p>
<p>A lot of exciting things happened.  Among the most exciting to me was the public unveiling of <br />
<a href="http://ruby.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  I&#8217;ve had a version of Maglev on my computer for about a month now, but <br />
I haven&#8217;t been able to talk about it. Now that it has been announced, most things I know are fair game.</p>
<p><a href="http://avibryant.com">Avi Bryant</a> and I met at the first RubyConf.  He&#8217;s been a fan and friend of Ruby ever <br />
since.  He happens to be doing mostly Smalltalk these days, but he&#8217;s been following the Ruby and (more <br />
recently) Rails communities closely.  After that first RubyConf, we reconnected while both attending <a href="http://dreamsongs.com">Dick <br />
Gabriel&#8217;s</a> pilot <span class="caps">MFA</span> in Software Development program at <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/"><span class="caps">UIUC</span></a> in <br />
early 2003.  Avi&#8217;s been talking since then about running Ruby on a Smalltalk VM.<br />
I&#8217;ve even started my own attempt once or twice, based on Avi&#8217;s ideas of how it could be done.</p>
<p>Given Avi&#8217;s interest in Ruby on Smalltalk and that he also created the mind-bending <br />
<a href="http://seaside.st">Seaside</a> web application framework, we invited him to keynote at last year&#8217;s RailsConf.  It was there, in his <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/#574286">message from the future</a> keynote, that he made public<br />
his belief that Ruby could benefit from being hosted on a mature, dynamic (Smalltalk) VM.</p>
<p>It was also, as I understand it, from that talk that <a href="http://gemstone.com">Gemstone</a> got the idea to run Rails.</p>
<p>The conversations started just after RailsConf last year, but it was only a few short months ago that Avi started work on <a href="http://maglev.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  That&#8217;s part of what makes it so amazing.  He and the<br />
engineers at Gemstone have gotten a huge subset of the Ruby language running on the Gemstone VM in just three months.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">RDBMS</span> R.I.P.</h1>
<p>Well, not really, but it&#8217;s fun to say.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about what Maglev promises.  By far the most interesting to me is <br />
Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s coolest about how Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine works within the context of Maglev is that it doesn&#8217;t<br />
feel like a persistence engine.  It&#8217;s just objects.  Everything&#8217;s just objects.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the average Rails application is a styled set of <span class="caps">CRUD</span> operations on top of an <br />
<em>object graph</em>.  That&#8217;s right, an object graph.  The fact that most Rails applications are backed<br />
by a relational database is a somewhat-necessary annoyance.</p>
<p>So in circumstances where you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>, why would you want to litter your pristine Ruby objects with <span class="caps">SQL</span> and other <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>-related work-arounds?  If it were possible to simply instantiate objects and not have to think about the underlying storage implementation at all, wouldn&#8217;t that be better?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Gemstone (and, therefore, Maglev) gives you.</p>
<p>There were questions during the demo about ActiveRecord compatibility.  To me, building in ActiveRecord <br />
compatibility is worse than a waste of time.  Sure, there are things in ActiveRecord which would be useful <br />
regardless of the storage mechanism.  Declarative relationships and validations are examples.  But, when <br />
you&#8217;re dealing with objects in memory, the idea of a :conditions clause with <span class="caps">SQL</span> in it is absolutely <br />
unnecessary and unappealing.</p>
<h1>Fast as hell</h1>
<p>Avi and the Gemstone people knew from their understanding of how the VM works that a Ruby implementation<br />
on Gemstone would be really fast.  They were right.  But as I said, the speed of the implementation is <br />
secondary to the persistence engine.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s really really fast.  On micro-benchmarks, it&#8217;s up to 100 times faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.</p>
<p>As has already been whined about ad nauseam, micro-benchmarks can be misleading.  They test very specific <br />
parts of the implementation and don&#8217;t always give you a picture of what real-world application performance <br />
will be like. So, let&#8217;s take this approach with the Maglev benchmarks: it&#8217;s fast enough.  It&#8217;s probably a<br />
lot faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.  And, we&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">MRI</span> for years for real applications.</p>
<p>Good enough.  Probably awesome.  But at least good enough.</p>
<p>Now is it going to slow down as they start implementing more of the libraries and language features? That&#8217;s<br />
the conventional wisdom.  I say <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>Smalltalk and Ruby are, as Avi has said numerous times, essentially the same language.  So the Gemstone VM<br />
has been tailor-made for running dynamic language code with closures, continuations, etc. and has been<br />
doing it for years.  Imagine the process, then, of converting Ruby to Smalltalk.  It&#8217;s in most cases<br />
a fairly straightforward language to language translation.</p>
<p>Where it <em>isn&#8217;t</em> as simple as that, Gemstone have a pretty big advantage:  they own the VM and they can <br />
change it to fit what Ruby needs.</p>
<p>I expect Maglev to get <em>faster</em> as the team starts to spend time on optimization.  So far, they&#8217;re in the<br />
&#8220;make it run&#8221; phase of the process.  Remember, three months in.</p>
<p>Antonio Cangiano <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/06/05/maglev-handles-trees-like-a-monkey/">also had a look at Maglev recently</a> and has a bit more to say about the specifics of Maglev performance</p>
<h1>Ruby Compliance (or &#8220;it runs WEBRick!&#8221;)</h1>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for Maglev?  As the Gemstone team has said, their next goal is to start running and passing<br />
the Ruby specs created by the other Ruby implementers.  They hadn&#8217;t prioritized this leading up to RailsConf,<br />
because, RailsConf being a web development conference, they wanted us all to see WEBRick running.</p>
<p>But, hey, they have WEBRick running!  Have you looked at the code for WEBRick?  That&#8217;s a lot of Ruby.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to a report on how well the Ruby specs run at this moment.  I think everyone will be<br />
pleasantly surprised.  And the specs will give the team a clear goal to work toward.</p>
<h1>So Will I Use This Thing?!</h1>
<p>When you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> (more often than you think) or you need scalable Ruby servers, I think<br />
Maglev is going to be an enticing alternative.  It&#8217;s not going to kill the other implementations.  Each<br />
implementation has its place. This isn&#8217;t a war, after all.</p>
<p>Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are for integration.  <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span> and Rubinius will compete for the &#8220;standard&#8221; use <br />
cases. Maglev is for big, distributed object stores inside of fast, scalable servers.  Think Rails, <br />
Adhearsion, or various coordination services running custom protocols on sockets.  Don&#8217;t run scripts in <br />
Maglev.  Don&#8217;t write desktop apps in Maglev.  Just use Maglev to serve tons of requests against billions of <br />
objects.</p>
<p>Maglev is good for the Ruby ecosystem just as <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span>, Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are good for the <br />
Ruby ecosystem.  The fact that we (will) have so many alternatives is a good thing.</p>
